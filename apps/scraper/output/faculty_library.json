The Archean ocean may have been strongly phosphorus-limited due to the selective binding of phosphate to iron oxyhydroxide. Here we report a new route to solubilizing phosphorus in the ancient oceans: reduction of phosphate to phosphite by iron(II) at low (<200 °C) diagenetic temperatures. Reduction of phosphate to phosphite was likely widespread in the Archean, as the reaction occurs rapidly and is demonstrated from thermochemical modeling, experimental analogs, and detection of phosphite in early Archean rocks. We further demonstrate that the higher solubility of phosphite compared to phosphate results in the liberation of phosphorus from ferruginous sediments. This phosphite is relatively stable after its formation, allowing its accumulation in the early oceans. As such, phosphorus, not as …",

Experimental band positions and intensities are compared to those predicted by density functional theory (DFT). Rh+ coordinates only four nitrogen molecules, whereas it can accommodate five carbonyl ligands.

However, in contrast to other phosphate minerals such as those within the apatite mineral group, there is little evidence of struvite on the early Earth and no detection of it in meteorites, where such high-N (nitrogen) and low-H2O conditions may be more commonplace.

As financial markets become more globally oriented, an international understanding of ARL determinants becomes even more important. This paper summarizes the extant literature on ARL and its determinants with an emphasis on international literature. Our review categorizes prior research based on company‐specific and audit‐related factors, and explores the associations that have been identified with respect to ARL. Finally, we identify possible areas of interest not currently present in the literature and speculate on several opportunities for future research.",

Managers with higher ability possess greater human capital and are better able to maintain the systems and controls underlying the company's financial information. We therefore predict that managers with higher ability produce more timely financial disclosures. We find that, incremental to firm‐level attributes, higher managerial ability is associated with a shorter earnings announcement lag, a shorter audit report lag, and a lower probability of a late US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Collectively, our results suggest that managerial ability has a positive influence on the timeliness of financial reporting.",

Our paper reviews the existing literature on the PCAOB’s four primary functions – registration, standard-setting, inspections, and enforcement. In particular, we examine PCAOB registration trends and evaluate the effects of PCAOB registration requirements on the issuer audit market, as well as discuss the relative costs and benefits (e.g., auditor behavior changes, improvements in audit quality, auditor perceptions) of the 16 auditing standards the PCAOB passed in its first 10 years of operation.

We find that stock returns around the development of Schedule UTP are negative, consistent with investors' concern that Schedule UTP would impose costs on firms. However, we document a significant positive stock price reaction to the release of the final draft of Schedule UTP in which the IRS relaxed many of the controversial provisions of Schedule UTP. Additionally, we find this positive reaction is incrementally larger for more tax-aggressive firms.

Further research has shown that having a corporate general counsel (GC) in a firm's top management team (top five highest-paid executives) significantly affects a firm's accounting and disclosure practices.

Specifically, we use the ascension of the corporate GC to top management as the identifying event in which the role and influence of the corporate GC becomes more salient. We find strong evidence that GC ascension to top management is associated with an increase in tax aggressiveness, as evidenced by greater book-tax differences and a higher likelihood of engaging in tax shelter activities.\nData Availability: Data are obtained from public sources identified in the paper.",

Prior research suggests that the GC position may have a significant influence in setting the tone at the top by promoting corporate integrity, ethics, and serving as a governance and monitoring mechanism, but also recognizes that prominent GCs may face ethical dilemmas, causing them to disregard professional responsibilities to curry the favor of the CEO and other executives. Using audit fees to proxy for audit engagement risk, we find a negative association between GC ascension to top management and audit fees. We investigate the mechanisms behind this relation and find GC ascension is associated with a reduction in both default risk and financial misstatement risk, which supports auditors’ perceived reduction in client business risk and audit risk, respectively.",

We investigate whether tax avoidance, management compensation, and debt agreements affect the expense classification election and whether this discretion has implications for financial statement users. We find firms that engage in tax avoidance activities, measured by effective tax rates (ETRs) and involvement in tax disputes, are more likely to include interest and penalties in tax expense. We also find that interest and penalties are more likely to be classified as tax expense when CEO compensation is more sensitive to pre-tax income. Finally, we find that UTB interest and penalty expense classification is associated with analysts' ETR forecast accuracy, which suggests there is a potential unintended …",

This comprehensive text--ideal for today's behavioral finance elective--links finance theory and practice to human behavior. The book begins by building upon the established, conventional principles of finance before moving into psychological principles of behavioral finance, including heuristics and biases, overconfidence, emotion and social forces. Readers learn how human behavior influences the decisions of individual investors and professional finance practitioners, managers, and markets. The book clearly explains what behavioral finance indicates about observed market outcomes as well as how psychological biases potentially impact the behavior of managers. Readers see, first-hand, the implications of behavioral finance on retirement, pensions, education, debiasing, and client management. This book spends a significant amount of time examining how behavioral finance can be used by practitioners today. Readers utilize theory and applications in every chapter with a wide variety of end-of-chapter exercises, discussion questions, simulations and experiments that reinforce the book's applied approach.",

We find a positive relation between overoptimism and uncertainty, but very little or no optimism when uncertainty is low. If the uncertainty surrounding a firm is high, analysts have fewer reputational concerns when they act on their inclinations to issue optimistic forecasts. Portfolio strategies based on these findings generate abnormal returns. The results suggest that greater prior uncertainty leads to higher analyst optimism, which in turn causes market overvaluation and profitable portfolio strategies.",

Arbitrage costs are low because these assets have low fundamental risk, low transactions costs, and high dividend yields. We find that Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), or spiders, do not trade at economically significant discounts, unlike closed-end mutual fund shares. Although individual investors invest much more heavily in SPDRs than in S&P500 stock, investor sentiment is not an important determinant of the discount. The SPDRs redemption feature facilitates arbitrage so that sophisticated traders can take advantage of and eliminate mispricing. However, we also report a larger, economically significant discount for MidCap SPDRs. MidCap SPDRs are designed to track the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 index, an index of moderate …",

The effect of a traded stock basket, Standard and Poor’s Depository Receipts (SPDRs), on the link between index and options markets is also examined. We find that pricing efficiency within option markets improves but there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that a stock basket enhances arbitrage across markets. When transactions costs and short sales constraints are included, very few violations of inter-market pricing relationships such as put–call parity are reported. However, violations of within market pricing relationships such as the box spread remain frequent. Extensive analysis suggests that the results are robust.",

The mispricing of country funds is related to momentum, illiquidity, and size effects.

In traditional finance, which has been the dominant paradigm for several decades, investors make rational choices leading to maximizing expected utility. The fundamental issues of traditional finance are classical decision theory, rationality, risk aversion, model portfolio theory (MPT), the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). However, evidence shows that many of the assumptions and findings associated with traditional finance are invalid. Thus, behavioral finance researchers turned to observed behaviors to develop models that describe how investors actually reach their decisions. Behavioral finance uses insights from the social sciences to better understand the investor behavior of individuals, groups, and markets.

We conduct nine experimental asset markets to compare behavior across three regulatory regimes: market closure, temporary halt, and no interruption. We find that the presence of a circuit breaker rule does not affect the magnitude of the absolute deviation in price from fundamental value or trading profit. The primary driver of price behavior is information. By comparison, trading activity is significantly affected by the presence of a circuit breaker. Market participants advance trades when a trading interruption is imminent.",

Short interest is defined in relation to trading volume. The results strongly support the assertion that short sales and excess returns are contemporaneously negatively correlated in Canada. The paper further finds that excess returns are more negative for small firms because the supply of shortable shares is constrained for these firms. Excess returns are less negative for stocks with associated options and convertible bonds. Importantly, the evidence is consistent with the proposition that informed traders short sell Canadian interlisted stocks in Canada, rather than the US, to exploit lower execution costs. Together the results suggest that less restrictive regulation of short sales will improve the efficiency of markets.",

However, institutional design has a significant impact on deviations in prices from fundamental values, particularly for an asset with lottery characteristics.

The migration of Te inclusions was also observed for annealing in a temperature-gradient field. We recorded a loss of resistivity of the detector-grade CZT after annealing in a Cd vapor. The underlying mechanism of this loss was discussed, and solutions including two-step annealing (Cd annealing followed by Te annealing) and one-step annealing with Cd and Zn pressure control were proposed to maintain high resistivity.",

          "abstract": "Cadmium manganese telluride (CdMnTe) is one of the semiconductor materials with potential applications at room-temperature for nuclear and radiological detection. CdMnTe crystals grown by Bridgman technique are prone to tellurium inclusions and related defects that limit their performance as X-rays and gamma-rays detectors. The major reason for this is that they are grown in a tellurium-rich environment. These defects could trap charges that are generated by X-rays and gamma rays thereby degrading the charge transport properties of the detectors and reducing their carrier lifetime. This in turn leads to poor performance by the detector. One of the solutions to this problem is post-growth thermal annealing. In this paper we present experimental results of annealing a CdMnTe wafer at 720 oC and in cadmium vapor. The CdMnTe wafer and cadmium were sealed in a quartz ampoule at a vacuum of 10-5 mbar. We used a three-zone furnace that enabled us to adjust the three heating elements to get a flat region of 720 oC in the temperature profile where the wafer was annealed. Infrared transmission microscopy showed changes to the sizes and positions of the tellurium inclusions. There are reductions in the dimensions of the medium-size Te inclusions. Some Te inclusions were completely eliminated while others broke up to form much smaller inclusions. Current-voltage measurements showed that the resistivity of the CdMnTe wafer was reduced by 71%, from 2.44 x 105 Ω-cm to 7.17 x 104 Ω-cm after annealing in Cd vapor.",

While the results are preliminary and focus on the whole network of 23 students at the HBCU and 25 students at the PWI, they are promising and help us better understand the importance and role of networks in student belonging at the two institutions. Social network analysis is a methodological approach that examines the relationships an individual actor or actors have with other individuals, groups, or organizations in an environment. The relationships are referred to as links, edges, or ties. Actors are referred to as nodes, alters, or vertices and may be places, organizations, or people. A primary goal of social network analysis is to depict the structure of a group (Wasserman & Faust 1994) by examining important relationships reflected in the strength, direction, and complexity (or number) of ties embedded in a network. The strength of such an approach is that it enables an analysis of social phenomena beyond the abstract social structures (eg social, economic, political) traditionally studied by researchers in the social and behavioral sciences (Wellman 1999). Ego-centered (or personal) networks make the individual the focus of attention where ego describes people (alters) close to him or her (Boissevain 1974; Wellman & Berkowitz 1988). According to Wellman (1999), such investigations “enable researchers to study community ties, whoever with, wherever located, and however structured… and avoid the trap of looking for community only in spatially defined ways”(p. 19).

The central objective of the project is to conduct a comparative study of the factors affecting the success and pathways to engineering careers of African American students at a Predominantly White Institution (PWI), the University of Toledo, and a Historically Black University (Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University). Through this research we hope to gain insight into the factors affecting the social and academic well-being of students at PWIs and HBCUs from a psychological and anthropological perspective. For students from underrepresented groups in STEM at both HBCUs and PWIs it is generally recognized that social capital in the form of familial, peer and mentor support is critical to persistence in their major field of study. However, the role that embedded networks within student groups in general, and minority engineering affinity groups in particular, play in engineering students’ identity formation and academic success is not well understood. It is also not clear how other factors including institutional support and the attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented minority students affect the ability of these students to integrate into the social and academic systems at their institutions and how these factors influence the formation and development of their identities as engineers.

The study focuses on investigating the criticality of the following three factors: 1. The attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented students and how these attitudes influence their classroom and advising interactions and expectations, and the impact this has on the students’ sense of belonging and academic success; 2. The existing institutional support mechanisms at both institutions and students’ perceptions of their efficacy and the role they perceive these mechanisms play in their academic success; and 3. The influence of student organizations- specifically underrepresented minority engineering affinity groups and the embedded networks therein on the social and academic integration of African American students at the two types of institutions.",

For this reason, energy efficiency in manufacturing facilities is increasingly important for reducing operating costs and improving profits. Using microgrids to generate local sustainable power should reduce energy consumption from the main utility grid along with energy costs and carbon emissions. Also, microgrids have the potential to serve as reliable energy generators in international locations where the utility grid is often unstable. For this research, a smart microgrid system was designed as part of an innovative load management option to improve energy utilization through active Demand-Side Management (DSM). An intelligent active DSM algorithm was developed to manage the intermittent nature of the microgrid and instantaneous demand of the site loads. The controlling algorithm required two input signals; one from the microgrid indicating the availability of renewable energy and another from the manufacturing process indicating energy use as a percent of peak production. Based on these inputs the algorithm had three modes of operation: normal (business as usual), curtailment (shutting off non-critical loads), and energy storage. The results show that active management of a manufacturing microgrid has the potential for saving energy and money by intelligent scheduling of process loads.",

          "abstract": "Cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor has applications in the detection of Xrays and gamma-rays at room temperature without having to use a cooling system. Chemical etching and chemo-mechanical polishing are processes used to smoothen CdZnTe wafer during detector device fabrication. These processes reduce surface damages left after polishing the wafers. In this paper, we compare the effects of etching and chemo-mechanical polishing on CdZnTe nuclear detectors, using a solution of hydrogen bromide in hydrogen peroxide and ethylene glycol mixture. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to monitor TeO2 on the wafer surfaces. Current-voltage and detector-response measurements were made to study the electrical properties and energy resolution. XPS results showed that the chemical etching process resulted in the formation of more TeO2 on the detector surfaces compared to chemo-mechanical polishing. The electrical resistivity of the detector is of the order of 1010 Ω-cm. The chemo-mechanical polishing process increased the leakage current more that chemical etching. For freshly treated surfaces, the etching process is more detrimental to the energy resolution more than chemo-mechanically polishing. The energy resolutions of the CdZnTe wafers are expected to improve as the surfaces stabilize and result in reduced surface currents.",

          "abstract": "Low enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of African American engineering students in the United States are a cause for concern [1]. Consequently, over the last decade there has been an upsurge of research identifying factors that have contributed to the problems encountered by African American students in higher education institutions in general, and in STEM fields in particular [2, 3]. The key factors identified as contributing to the attrition of minority African American students include perceptions of racism on campus, internalization of stereotypes, feelings of alienation and rejection, and inadequate support systems [4, 5]. In this context, considerations of institutional demographic characteristics, including the ethnic makeup of the student body is essential. Studies demonstrate that African American students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) experience lower levels of isolation and overt racism, and higher levels of retention compared to African American students in Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs)[6, 7]. While some studies suggest that African American students experience lower levels of stereotype threat in HBCUs [8, 9], other studies indicate that there is little significant difference between students attending PWIs and HBCUs in their perceptions of stereotype threat. Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a national sample of engineering students, Brown, Morning, and Watkins report that students enrolled in HBCUs had more favorable perceptions of their college experience and that the higher graduation rate of African American students in HBCUs compared to their PWI counterparts could be …",

The regulation of midwifery services—of certified nurse‐tnidwives (CNMs)—relative to obstetricians (OBs) is analyzed within this framework. Demand‐side (quality assurance) effects are distinguished from supply‐side (Stigler‐Peltzman) effects in the model. Since both unambiguously predict a price increase, we focus on the regulatory impact on quantity. We find, within the empirical model, that while both effects are present, supply‐restricting effects dominate quality assurance in the U.S. market for CNM services. When mean regulations are compared to minimum regulations in the sample, CNM births increase from just under 6% of all births to a little over 11%. On net, regulation reduces the quantity of CNM births.",

Our results reveal a significant net decrease in quantity from the imposition of state occupational regulation in the cosmetology market.

When only a fraction of a tract or parcel of land is condemned, the appraiser must not only estimate the market value of the taking at the time of the condemnation, but must also estimate the consequential damages to the remaining part of the tract or parcel, less any benefits to the remaining part of the tract or parcel.

Industry-wide averages can be a useful starting point in calculating a reasonable royalty as royalty rates in various industries exhibit distinctly different central tendencies.

From the literature, the author uncovers two main critiques of neoclassicism: that neoclassic theory is unrealistic and impersonal. Neoclassic theory has enormous consequences for the civic mission of social studies. The author investigates the extent to which neoclassical theory makes for good citizenship and is desirable for a democratic society.",

Becoming teacher is a way for teachers and teacher educators to rethink professional identity for the fostering of justice and equity.",

The study revealed several trends and issues related to K-12 economics textbooks, including publishing trends, the extent to which economics curriculum is relevant and enactive, and the influence of neoclassical economic theory in serving as the “official knowledge” undergirding the curriculum. The review presents debates in the field related to these issues.

After presenting an overview of the field of social studies and concerns over disciplinary definitions and designations, we show how theory can be put into practice with descriptions of three activities we did with elementary and secondary-focused preservice teachers designed with an intra-disciplinary approach in mind.

After all, it is likely that your students already know how to shop at a grocery store.

They present opportunities for inquiry into geographic, civic, and economic concerns in students’ communities. It is precisely the students’ familiarity with these stores that lends itself to critical inquiry and fosters civic agency. Such field trips not only align with social studies content in civics, geography, and economics, but they can also inspire students and teachers to ask thoughtful questions about their communities and to think about human behavior—including their own.",

Specifically, we share what was produced when we applied a framework underpinned by posthumanist concepts to three children’s books centering robots. Using Jackson and Mazzei’s thinking with theory to plug into these books, this article raises (re)new(ed) questions about the intersections of literacy, humanism, and droids. It proposes that pairingposthumanist concepts with droidial texts can be generative in thinking about, critiquing, and predicting changes with the (ever-developing) relationship(s) between humans and machines.",

Ultimately, our findings suggested that these collaborative and nondirective communicative approaches played a significant role to enable our candidates to demonstrate self-directed and self-regulated learning.",

The goals of the study were to determine whether CRP was emphasized in course descriptions, informational materials, activities, assessments, and rubrics, and to determine whether there was alignment between CRP-related descriptions, activities, assessments, and rubrics. Findings indicate that CRP was not strongly emphasized or well aligned in most courses. Indeed, across most or all courses, we found the following: a lack of emphasis on democratic classrooms; a lack of alignment between CRP objectives, assignments, and rubrics; a lack of evidence that depth of CRP knowledge was required across courses; problems with course design; and a lack of emphasis on identity and cultural competence.

There are many moments within a school day when teachers must make decisions quickly about instructional methods, behaviour interventions, and student supports. Research indicates that teachers’ dispositions may have something to do with their ability to make those decisions (Sorensen, 2014; Warren, 2018). While there is some debate about the use of teacher disposition instruments as they relate to reliability, they are widely used in teacher preparation programmes in the United States and internationally (Warren, 2018).

However, even with the current enthusiasm for the establishing the new practices, a working definition of pre-service co-teaching remains elusive. Thus, the study of the voices of educators who are involved in co-teaching is essential as universities make the transition from single-taught to co-taught clinical experiences.

Teacher candidates in a literacy assessment course assessed and tutored students in this summer academy. The chapter describes the tutoring program and the pre-service teachers' response to a teaching efficacy survey based on the work with students. Findings indicate that after the tutoring experience, teacher candidates felt more competent to engage students and to use literacy strategies with the students.",

The study was designed to examine how empowerment was realized in the lives of those students. The author examines the way the students discuss their experiences in school, at home, and in their community in order to uncover the extent of empowerment each one may or may not be experiencing in his life. In addition, the author looks at the ways their dialogues uncover emerging themes that show how school may or may not be fostering youth empowerment. Chapter one begins by describing the process the author went through in making decisions about designing the study and presenting it. Chapter two includes a brief review of the literature on youth empowerment and marginalized youth. Chapter three examines interpretive phenomenology and the importance of Vagle (2011) on this study. In particular Karin Dahlbergs work on bridling (2001) is of importance to this study, as that practice was an integral part of the author distancing herself from the data and the words of the students. Chapter four highlights four of the participants as they discuss empowerment and as each highlights issues of control, power, and inadequacy. Finally, chapter five includes an extension of the review of literature in order to explore literature relevant to the themes that emerged during the study, and then concludes with a discussion of the implications and significance of this study. Examinations of the dialogues of each of the students highlighted here reveal a disconnect between the students and the system of …",

This research was enacted at a research-intensive university in the United States in 2020 and 2021. We describe the need for the shift in stance to students as partners in our institution as well as what the findings indicate as imperatives for teachers in both K–12 settings and institutions of higher education. The findings indicate how teachers’ mental health and experiences of stress were affected by specific attributes of the pandemic and pandemic teaching (which aligns with the majority of COVID-19 research in education), as well as how some learned to cope with these demands. Findings also indicate the need for flexibility in all learning environments.",

They can read; they are performing below grade level.\" The first candidate responds,\" The point is that mine is above grade level!\" Finally, they call a professor to come over and assist.\" Dr. Adams, what are we supposed to do? These kids are all on different performance levels!” Dr. Adams replies,“Welcome to a typical classroom. 22 The candidates decide to continue their discussion in their regular class meeting. Additional strategies seem to be needed to meet the needs of each student.

Supervisory practices were situated in a collegial, reflective and developmental model of supervision. The participant sample included 41 teacher candidates, along with 41 of their collaborating teachers and 15 field supervisors who supervised four to six candidates throughout the yearlong experience. Our findings indicate that we, along with our collegial supervisors, used collaborative and non-directive approaches to structure the dialogue with our teacher candidates and the collaborating teachers as well as goal-setting techniques to promote self-directed and self-regulated learning in the candidate. Implications of the study include the following needs for colleges of education:(a) to prepare supervisors specifically to support their candidates in theorizing practice and justifying their instructional decisions with research;(b) to develop a shared language that defines and describes various forms and notions of assessment; and (c) to provide additional support and professional development for supervisors responsible for supervision of candidates in P-12 programs in this new era of national assessment and accountability for the outcomes of their candidates.",

The initial findings of this case study were that lesson planning, teacher dispositions, and willingness to accept feedback are critical for PSTs. Additionally, a major concern in the findings is the increased evidence of mental health concerns for the children and PSTs. The findings indicate a need for focused training on social–emotional learning with special care relating to stressors caused by COVID-19. There must also be additional training for PSTs on explicit and detailed lesson plans, adjusting their dispositions, and science-based literacy instruction taught in literacy blocks.",

This study investigates the effects of biochar on removing the VOCs emission from asphalt. The biochar was obtained from the pyrolyzed productions of pig manure, waste wood and straw biomasses. Molecular model for the adsorption of the VOCs was developed and used to measure the adsorption energy and heat. The VOCs removal model was built and used to determine the VOCs removal mechanism in the asphalt. The results showed that biochar could remove alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and sulphide compounds because of its intrinsic carbon negativity and porosity. Furthermore, source of the biochar was an influential factor on the adsorption of the VOCs compounds. Based on the results, waste wood …",

          "abstract": "Today, construction is essential to every economy since it employs many workers and significantly contributes to GDP. The construction industry’s efficiency has lagged behind other industries for decades due to low productivity, a lack of research, and poor adoption of advancements. Fortunately, the successful development of digital technologies such as Digital Twin (DT) has facilitated growth in many sectors, and DT has the potential to address challenges in building construction projects. While DT is a virtual replica that provides real-time data and analysis of a physical asset to optimize its performance, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a collaborative process for creating, managing, and exchanging information throughout a construction project. BIM is the most efficient way to create an accurate, high-value DT and support industry transformation. An integrated DT and BIM platform can improve building design, construction, and performance in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sectors. Based on a literature review, this research aims to clarify and differentiate DT from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, such as BIM. Related publications from articles about DT and BIM in the construction industry were selected, identified, and organized after careful research of the relevant scientific databases. The research has three primary objectives: (1) to examine the present applications of DT and BIM in the construction industry; (2) to emphasize the similarities and differences between the two; and (3) to develop solutions and design methods for BIM and DT integration in building construction.",

A series of tests, including empirical, viscosity, rutting, fatigue, cracking, storage stability, and chemical tests, were performed to determine the influence of soda lignin on asphalt binder. Test results revealed that the addition of lignin helps to reduce the temperature sensitivity of the asphalt by increasing its hardness and decreasing its ductility. At the same time, the incorporation of soda lignin powder also increased the viscosity of base asphalt with the increase in lignin content.

The mixture properties were predicted from X-ray CT images of the aggregate, mastic, and air voids. Moreover, the asphalt mixture images were utilized in modeling using the distinct element method approach for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches. Three replicates of 3D distinct element model and six replicates of 2D distinct element model were simulated. 2D images were visualized by vertical orientation so that real distribution of air void levels could be captured. The mastic dynamic modulus and aggregate elastic modulus were determined and used as input parameters in the distinct element modeling. The strain …",

The total energy consumption values of Taichang highway are 20 % higher than that of the Dayun highway. The global warming potential indicators of Taichang (asphalt mixture), Dayun (asphalt mixture), and Deda (cement concrete) are 181 kg eq.CO2, 285 kg eq.CO2, and 330 kg eq.CO2, respectively during the materials production stage.

In this study, four-point bending beam fatigue testing has been used for a typical Michigan Asphalt mixture under various loading frequencies (10Hz, 5Hz, 1Hz, 0.5 Hz, and 0.1 Hz) and test temperatures (21.3 C, 13, and 4 C). This study includes evaluation of different fatigue prediction models (Asphalt Institute Model and Shell Model) over wide ranges of laboratory testing conditions. In addition, this paper also provides a linkage between compression modulus and flexural stiffness, this study helps substantiate the concept that compression modulus can be used for evaluating both rutting due to vertical compression and fatigue due to flexural bending. The results in this study showed that there is a strong linear correlation between the flexural stiffness and compression modulus, with the flexural stiffness about 30% lower than the compression modulus.",

The inequality hypotheses investigated first overall correlations between warmth and competence, and whether these co-varied with Gini inequality coefficients. The inequality focus also compared how stereotypic traits and their respective socio-structural predictors vary across societies. Inequality emphasizes more than one dimension of intergroup perception to compensate. The stereotype content model (SCM) hypothesizes that many societal stereotypes are ambivalent. The stereotype content model suggests that depicting societal groups in ambivalent ways—such as fortunate in one sphere while unfortunate in another—may mask socio-economic disparities, facilitating, as a consequence, the rationalization and maintenance of the status quo. According to the SCM, competence and warmth …",

We frame good or bad barrels in the environmental context as a proxy of high or low probability of getting caught for dishonesty, respectively. We theorize: The magnitude and intensity of the relationship between love of money and dishonest prospect (dishonesty) may reveal how individuals frame dishonesty in the context of two levels of subjective norm—perceived corporate ethical values at the micro-level (CEV, Level 1) and Corruption Perceptions Index at the macro-level (CPI, Level 2), collected from multiple sources …",

Antiretroviral therapy has transformed the course of HIV/AIDS to a treatable, chronic illness worldwide. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a group intervention using motivational interviewing (MI) to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and use of risk reduction behaviors (RRB) among HIV-infected women in Nigeria. Recruited participants (n= 60) were randomly assigned to the motivational group or the health promotion program (HPP) control group. The 6 month follow-up results indicate that, compared to the control group, MI participants reported significantly higher levels of adherence to ART, higher knowledge of HIV, higher use of condoms/protection during sexual encounters and decision-making not to have sex when no protection was available. The MI participants also had fewer mean number of sexual partners. MI in group format shows promise in promoting adherence to ART and use of RRB in HIV-infected Nigerian women.",

Furthermore, South African managers endorse issues such as plan for knowledge acquisition, distribution, interpretation and organizational memory/performance.

Using the Differential Emotions Scale (DES) which focuses on ten discrete emotions, and building upon Boyle’s (1984) seminal work, this study reports a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for individual items across raters. The findings further indicate that majority of the DES items are sensitive indicators of the different innate and universal facial expressions. However, the construct requires revision so that it offers the examiner maximum flexibility in assessment at diverse levels, in terms of more extensive norming and programmatic replication. In brief, the DES potentially has much to offer provided that it is adequately developed for use in non-Western nations or contexts.",

This study explores the dark side of decision-making, e.g., avaricious monetary aspirations and corruption (dishonesty). Corruption involves greed, money, and risky decision-making. It is a risky prospect, involving a cost-benefit analysis of self-interest.

Each individual's human emotional experience is culturally constructed or socio-culturally created under specific conditions, with the involvement of other human agents or variables to the causal processes. To advance research, we draw from theories and philosophical thoughts across cultures, from ancient times to modern era. In that context, emotion is the sine qua non of the totality of Yorùbá's beliefs about reality and it is the heart and soul of connectedness between people or places. The present study assessed human emotion factors among a business-oriented population and compared these views with distinctions proposed in the literature. Using a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for individual items across raters. Neither the Interest subscale or Surprise subscale nor the Guilt subscale demonstrated significant retest correlations in a comparison of the General and Specific Depression conditions; and also, of the Specific Depression and pre-examination conditions. More specifically, culturally mediated beliefs, values and traditions associated with socialization practices (political skills in case of workplace), have been hypothesized to play a role in the kinds of emotions display. Alternative interpretations of the data are examined and theoretical issues in need of further clarification are discussed. By discussing caveats, the chapter laid foundations for artifacts that can guide future thoughtful research and the potential utility of this measure, and the likes …",

Guided by theories that position curriculum at the intersection of discourse, context, and personal meaning-making, we sought to describe the ways in which intentions for GCE reflect broader societal discourses of citizenship and how curricula allow students to tackle tensions surrounding national and global citizenship. We found that Singapore and Hong Kong have adopted depoliticized forms of citizenship as a means of inoculation against global ills. These types of citizenship are more nationalistic than global in nature; moral rather than political; and focused mainly on utilitarian goals to produce adaptable workers able to support national economic projects in the global economy. Although critical, transnational and other emergent civic perspectives are apparent in both cities, the data yielded little evidence of curricular opportunities for students to become exposed to alternative discourses and reconcile discursive contradictions. The findings inform current literature by illuminating the nexus of local and global discursive practices, implicating the ability of curricula to accommodate both novel and established civic identities, and forwarding suggestions to bridge disconnections between theoretical and local curricular definitions of global citizenship.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been much interest in civic education internationally. As the number of democratic nations increased in Latin America, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe, policy makers have focused on how to instill democratic beliefs and values in youth. In older democracies, policy makers have been concerned about how to stimulate youth civic-political engagement. Within Europe, politicians and educators have been interested in developing a European identity. Additionally, interest in civic education has intensified as a consequence of globalization; national policy makers want to know how their youth “measure up” to peers in other countries in terms of their knowledge in the civic and political arena, as well as in other areas such as literacy, mathematics, and science. Accompanying this multifaceted interest in civic education and civic-political outcomes has been an increase in political socialization research internationally.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, political scientists, political psychologists, and social studies education researchers in the United States (and to a lesser extent Western Europe) studied the processes by which young people acquired their civic-political knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors. At the time, scholars sought to identify the links between particular inputs (messages from family, school, and media) and outputs (student knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors) in the belief these would predict adult orientations (for a review of the early studies see Ehman, 1980). Students were viewed as passive recipients of information about formal political institutions and processes. Since that early period, political …",

In contrast to most countries, the constitutionally democratic state of Singapore explicitly assigns separate citizenship roles to students from different education tracks. Premised on the principle of meritocracy, the Singapore state has also developed separate citizenship education programs incorporating different values, skills, and knowledge for students from the academic and vocational tracks. The study illustrates sharp disparities in how citizenship and democracy is conceptualized by students from the different education tracks. The differences in civic efficacy, learning outcomes, knowledge, and skills also closely parallel the different goals of the social studies and citizenship education …",

This qualitative study explores how democratic citizenship education is enacted in two secondary schools with very dissimilar academic programmes and policies. A key finding in the study is fissures in perceptions of civic engagement and democratic rights between students from the two schools, thus suggesting that academic programmes and policies can differentiate the manner in which students are prepared to fulfil their roles as citizens.",

We then survey case studies from selected Asian societies to illustrate that—rather than addressing public issues and promoting social justice—nationalist and neoliberal discourses work together to forward unsustainable growth that further polarises societies based on social class, power and privilege (Mitchell, 2003). Finally, we recommend future directions in GCE research and practice. By illuminating empirically grounded studies from Asia and by reconciling these examples with theories of curriculum as discourse, our aim is to contribute to efforts in promoting GCE as a means towards humanistic transformation (UNESCO, 2014) in nation-centric and neoliberal times (Nussbaum, 2010; Torres, 2009).",

To develop this argument, we review theories and critiques of cosmopolitan forms of global citizenship education deemed necessary to prepare young people for complex global social conditions. We discuss cosmopolitan principles on identity, values, and deliberation and draw on critical cosmopolitanism and Asian forms of cosmopolitanism to provide a discursive framework for analyzing curricular intentions in the two cases.",

The book includes chapters that provide: 1) conceptions and frameworks of GCE in Asian societies; 2) analyses of contexts, policies, and curricula that influence GCE reform efforts in Asia; and 3) studies of students’ and teachers’ experiences of GCE in schools in different Asian contexts. While much citizenship education has focused on constructions and enactments of GCE in Western societies, this volume re-centers investigations of GCE amid Asian contexts, identities, and practices. In doing so, the contributors to this volume give voice to scholarship grounded in Asia, and the book provides a platform for sharing different approaches, strategies, and research across Asian societies. As nations grapple with how to prepare young citizens to face issues confronting our world, this book expands visions of how GCE might be conceptualized, contextualized, and taught; and how innovative curriculum initiatives and pedagogies can be developed and enacted.",

Analyses of qualitative data reveal students' perceived lack of civic competence to effect systemic change within their school environment and in the larger political arena. This perceived lack of civic competence can be attributed largely to rigid and hierarchical classroom, school and political structures, and the pragmatic focus of Singapore society. We discuss findings in light of civic education research, policy and practice.",

Through our analysis of syllabus documents and broader societal discourses, we found several common core values across the two settings that simultaneously represented nationalist and global neoliberal discourses of citizenship. Rather than emphasizing political or civic concerns, curricular and societal discourses worked together to underscore self-management and the creation of orderly national societies attractive to global capital and necessary for economic growth in a competitive global economy.

The approach makes use of Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory to model the dynamics of the DRT system in the equilibrium condition and approximate the generalized cost for users when the operating capacity is inadequate to serve the time-dependent demand over the peak period without excess delay.

While supply increase might aggravate the problem, pricing is envisaged to relieve large cities from adverse traffic effects (congestion and pollution, among others). Nevertheless, pricing has its own drawbacks, often overlooked by the operators of the networks. It will cause changes in the travel behavior of the different groups and their demands (shoppers, retailers, and even basic businesses/ employees). This paper presents an extensive review of the subject, and an equilibrium model to estimate the long–run effects of a cordon pricing scheme. The problem of designing a price for a Central Business District (CBD) cordon is formulated in this study as a bi-level optimization problem. The lower level problem is a joint trip production-distribution-mode choice-assignment problem, with interactions among three groups of the users …",

A stated preference survey is conducted to show the heterogeneity in the preferences of users and its dependence to the purpose of the trips over the weekdays and weekends.

The objective is to optimize the work start times of individual firms with minimum deviations from their initial schedules while taking into account that commuters choose their departure time selfishly to minimize their travel cost. We formulate the optimal work schedule problem in a bicentric network as a multi-objective optimization program that simultaneously minimizes the total travel time and the schedule deviation for the firms while satisfying near-equilibrium temporal conditions.

          "abstract": "Users of transportation systems need to make a variety of different decisions for their trips in the network, while their objective is to keep the generalized costs of their own trips minimized. In the transportation network, there is a diversity of different factors that can influence the decisions of the users, while the relative importance of these factors varies among the heterogeneous users with different trip purposes. Nonetheless, the cumulative result of the individual decisions of the users seeking to minimize their costs according to their own preferences leads to the user equilibrium condition in which no one can reduce his/her cost by changing his/her decision. In this research, we adapt the concept of the efficient frontier from portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952) in finance in order to model the bicriterion choice behavior of users with heterogeneous preferences in transportation networks. We show that the efficient frontier has a set of primary properties that remains general in different problems. Thus, the primary properties of the efficient frontier can be employed to analytically model and solve different bicriterion choice problems in transportation. For the first application, we use these properties to propose an analytical model for the morning commute problem when there is a heterogeneity associated with preferences of the users (Vickrey, 1969; Daganzo, 1985). A dynamic pricing strategy is also proposed to optimize the bottleneck by minimizing the total cost for users. In addition to the morning commute problem, Vickrey’s congestion theory is also shown to have applications in modeling and optimizing the operation of the demand responsive transit …",

It uses AsianCrit, a branch of critical race theory, as a theoretical lens to analyze and explicate common patterns across various states’ scripting of Asian American experience in their U.S. history standards. Informed by AsianCrit, the article describes and troubles invisibility and consequent messages about Asian Americans and their experience in the story of the United States told from state U.S. history standards. The study suggests the benefit of AsianCrit as a theoretical, methodological tool to read and disrupt racism embedded in curriculum scripting of U.S. history. The study also adds a new knowledge to the long-held scholarship on inclusion and representation of historically marginalized groups in official school knowledge.",

Content analysis of the textbooks suggests the overall narrative of Asian American history in U.S. history textbooks aligns with the grand narrative of American history, that is, the “story of progress.” This major storyline of Asian Americans – that they suffered from nativist racism and discrimination for a long time, overcame these obstacles through their hard work and efforts, and achieved the American dream – fits well into the master narrative of American progress, highlighting the process of their belonging to the U.S. as citizens. This storyline misrepresents the realities and diversity among Asian ethnic groups …",

The findings reveal that except for Japanese incarceration and anti-Asian immigration laws, Asian Americans are largely invisible in the state standards and, when included, they are primarily depicted as victims of nativist racism with a lack of civic agency as well as new immigrants with little contribution to nation-building.

Asian Americans are an extraordinarily diverse group of people, yet are often viewed through stereotypical lenses: as Chinese or Japanese only, as recent immigrants who do not speak English, as exotic foreigners, or as a “model minority” who do well in school. This fundamental misperception of who Asian Americans are begins with young learners―often from what they learn, or do not learn, in school. This book sets out to amend the superficial treatment of Asian American histories in U.S. textbooks and curriculum by providing elementary teachers with a more nuanced, thematically driven account.

The study’s findings demonstrate that, following the COVID-19 pandemic and an upsurge in anti-Asian hate crime, the teachers’ experiences of racism and positions as Asian Americans and migrants in New York City had radically changed. Their shifted racialized experiences further influenced their elementary school teaching practices, compelling them to become committed to antiracist education. This longitudinal and timely study will contribute to the emerging literature on Asian American and migrant teachers, providing several implications for teacher education and future research.

These challenges included teacher candidates’ perception of authority/credibility of their professors who were foreign females from the “Third World”, teacher candidates’ deficit views on minoritized students, and the limited time and resources for teacher collaboration in teacher education. Despite these challenges, we believe this kind of project is necessary to move forward in teacher preparation for social justice education.",

These systems utilize solid-state ceramic oxides which offer enhanced stability, fuel flexibility, and high energy conversion efficiency throughout operation. However, the nature of system conditions, such as high temperatures, complex redox atmosphere, and presence of volatile reactive species become taxing on solid oxide materials and limit their viability during long-term operation. Ongoing research efforts to identify the material corrosion and degradation phenomena, as well as discover possible mitigation techniques to extend material efficiency and longevity, is the current focus of the research and industrial community. In this review, degradation processes in select solid oxide electrochemical systems, system components, and comprising materials will be discussed. Overall degradation phenomena are presented and certain degradation mechanisms are discussed. State-of-the-art technologies to mitigate or minimize the above-mentioned degradation processes are presented.",

Ideally, excess renewable energy generated during times of plenty can be stored in hydrogen and batteries for use during periods of insufficient electricity availability. Excess electricity from renewables can be fed into an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen and later used in fuel cells to produce electricity when needed, releasing the stored energy back to the grid.

The detection is based on the properties of the rail tracks and contact wires such as relative height, linearity and relative position with respect to other objects. Points classified as rail track are used in a 3D modelling algorithm. The modelling is done by first fitting a parametric model of a rail piece to the points along each track, and estimating the position and orientation parameters of each piece model. For each position and orientation parameter a smooth low-order Fourier curve is interpolated. Using all interpolated parameters a mesh model of the rail is reconstructed. The method is explained using two areas from a dataset acquired by a LYNX mobile mapping system in a mountainous area. Residuals between railway laser points and 3D models are in the range of 2 cm. It is concluded that a curve fitting algorithm is essential to reliably and accurately model the rail tracks by using the knowledge that railways are following a continuous and smooth path.",

Next, a preliminary model is created by fitting an ellipse to each extracted cross section. The model is refined by employing residual analysis and Baarda’s data snooping method to eliminate outliers. The final model is then generated by applying least squares adjustment to outlier-free data. The obtained results indicate that the tunnel’s main axis and 1551 cross sections at 0.1 m intervals are successfully extracted. Cross sections have an average semi-major axis of 7.8508 m with a standard deviation of 0.2 mm and semi-minor axis of 7.7509 m with a standard deviation of 0.1 mm. The average normal distance of points from the constructed model (average absolute error) is also 0.012 m. The developed algorithm is applicable to tunnels with any horizontal orientation and degree of curvature since it makes no assumptions, nor does it use any a priori knowledge regarding the tunnel’s curvature and horizontal orientation.",

The upgraded algorithm is applied to two datasets with quite different point sampling and complexity. First dataset is scanned by a terrestrial system and contains three million points covering 630 m of an inter-city railroad corridor. It presents a simple configuration with nonintersecting straight rail tracks and cables. Second dataset includes 80 m of a complex urban railroad environment comprising curved and merging rail tracks and intersecting cables.

This research aims to create such a 3D as-built plan using terrestrial LiDAR data while in this paper the aim is to extract insulators, which are key objects in electrical substations. This paper proposes a segmentation method based on a new approach of finding the principle direction of points’ distribution. This is done by forming and analysing the distribution matrix whose elements are the range of points in 9 different directions in 3D space. Comparison of the computational performance of our method with PCA (principal component analysis) shows that our approach is 25% faster since it utilizes zero-order moments while PCA computes the first- and second-order moments, which is more time-consuming. A knowledge-based approach has been developed to automatically recognize points on insulators. The method utilizes known insulator properties such as diameter and the number and the spacing of their rings. The results achieved indicate that 24 out of 27 insulators could be recognized while the 3 un-recognized ones were highly occluded. Check point analysis was performed by manually cropping all points on insulators. The results of check point analysis show that the accuracy, precision and recall of insulator recognition are 98%, 86% and 81%, respectively.

Flight parameters and weather conditions were the same on each site. The outputs were orthomosaics and digital surface models, whose accuracies were inspected by descriptive statistics and variance analysis tools. The data of the ultralight drone on the first site could not be processed due to strong wind, but its results for the second site (11 hectares) were comparable to those of survey-grade drones, i.e., the range and average of checkpoint errors for Mini2 were 0.17 m and 0.04 m, respectively, while those were 0.10 m and 0.02 m for Phantom4 and Mavic3E. In the third site (34 hectares), survey-grade drones produced accurate results with a checkpoint error range of 0.26 m, while that was 0.87 m for the ultralight drone, implying lower accuracy results. The results obtained suggest that ultralight drones under certain circumstances can produce reliable mapping products depending on weather conditions, the number and distribution of ground control points, and area size.

Tunnels are currently monitored by measuring a few benchmarks using total stations or other surveying instruments. These techniques are effective and precise, but also slow and expensive. In the case of rail tunnels, for example, the regular train schedule is disrupted whenever land surveyors have to operate inside the tunnel. This article presents a novel automated method for the geometric modelling of tunnels from mobile Lidar point clouds with sub-millimetre precision.

For example, one teacher provided inconsistent support for elementary students to analyze data, whereas another developed sophisticated support. The findings suggest that elements of the program, such as coherence, facilitated the learning, having implications for teacher educators.",

These reforms defined the new term, crosscutting concept (CCC), as a lens that has explanatory power across disciplines. To describe how researchers are examining and using the CCCs related to science teaching and learning, a literature review was conducted to identify articles that included the term “crosscutting concept” since its introduction in 2012. The articles were narrowed to those that use the term CCC as a component of the framing, analysis, findings, or discussion of their empirical or nonempirical article. A subset of the identified papers elaborated on the CCCs beyond existing policy documents and references. These papers were open‐coded to identify themes in how the CCCs were used. The identified themes suggest …",

Nineteen K-8 teachers in the USA, who were new to teaching engineering as part of a shift in science learning standards, participated. We focused on four areas of engineering practice and epistemology, namely the orientation of engineering toward solutions, the role of context in defining engineering design specifications, the role and nature of data and evidence, and the interdisciplinary nature of science and engineering. Comparisons of changes in teachers’ incorporation of epistemic practices show some reflection of changes in their views about the nature of engineering knowledge.

Project-based STEM units about environmental issues like water quality offer the possibility to create more expansive, equitable learning experiences. These units can leverage local problems and resources while also including the global dimensions of the issue to provide meaningful opportunities for diverse student sensemaking. However, even project-based STEM learning requires explicit attention to the agency of teachers, students, and place. In order to identify a set of design principles for supporting equitable learning in a project-based STEM curriculum, this manuscript brings together a set of empirical and theoretical frameworks including teacher participatory relationship with the curriculum, culturally sustaining pedagogy, critical pedagogy of place, and equitable sensemaking. The authors use these frameworks to describe a conceptual model of Participatory Relationship of Students, Communities, Teachers, Curriculum and Place. Then, the manuscript outlines a set of seven design principles that connect to the theoretical frameworks to the conceptual model and provide implementation strategies with examples of how we apply these design principles to a project-based STEM unit for 4–8 grade students. The design principles have implications for design of future project-based units and learning opportunities for teachers and students.",

Research indicates that students like OERs and do as well in classes with OERs as with traditional textbooks. However, there is little to no empirical evidence about students’ actual usage of OERs. This study addresses this gap by examining Google Analytics data from a free, online Technical Communication textbook. Results indicate that many students did not use the OER. A small number of students accessed the OER regularly, and a small number accessed it occasionally. All students who used the OER skimmed the contents.",

Using results from a quantitative study of students and faculty using the Open Technical Communication textbook, this paper provides valuable perspectives on actual use of an OER in the technical communication survey course. Results of the study revealed both expected and unexpected insights that indicate topics for further research. From the faculty survey, there may be a positive effect of faculty involvement in the creation and adoption process on their perception of the OER, and the relationship between faculty perceptions of student engagement and students’ actual academic achievement may not be a close one. From the student survey, students’ actual use of OER is about as inconsistent as their use of traditional commercial textbooks, students’ use of supplementary resources has a positive effect on their perception of the OER as long as they choose to use them, and students’ interest in an OER and their perception of its quality do not appear to be related.",

These publications were analyzed using the ideal speech communication situation, a theory developed by the German social philosopher, Jürgen Habermas. Within these texts, the existence and influence of distorted communication, as defined by Habermas, indicates when and where open, free communication broke down and influenced the course of scientific discussion. This dissertation’s analysis of the articles from 1967 shows that the publications contained communicative distortion, and the communicative distortion provides more than enough reason to doubt both the scientific validity of the reported LSD-chromosome damage and LSD-birth defects links and the reasoning behind the scientific consensus emerging at the end of 1967 that LSD did cause chromosome damage and birth defects. In terms of technical communication scholarship, this dissertation’s analysis demonstrates that Habermas’s theory of the ideal speech communication situation can be used as an analytical tool for rhetoric of science studies and contribute to the further development of the field.",

From 1978 through 2015, their prices went up by 987%; by comparison, the Consumer Price Index went up 266% over that same timespan (Perry, 2015), meaning textbooks' prices went up nearly four times as fast as other prices. Data from the 2022–23 academic year reveals that students spend an average of $1240 on books and supplies (CollegeData. com).\nAll interested parties--students, governments, and instructors alike--are all pushing back. Students often rent textbooks, and many others simply do not procure the required textbooks for their classes. Governments at both the federal and state level offer grants to lower the costs of textbooks (SPARC, 2016). Instructors have begun to develop open educational resources (OER).",

In the late nineteenth century, testimony became a common feature of literary works both fact and fiction. But with the rise of new journalism, the power of testimony could be undermined by anonymous, institutional voices—a Victorian subversion which continues to this day. Testimony on Trial examines the conflicts over testimony through the eyes of two of its major combatants, Joseph Conrad and Henry James. Brian Artese finds an overlooked yet direct inspiration for Heart of Darkness in the anti-testimonial scheming of Henry Morton Stanley and the New York Herald.

I argue that sympathetic penetration in the novel has always been torn in a battle between the implications of confession and testimony. Although James rejects testimonial narration in the novel because it lacks \"authority,\" his fiction vigorously argues that one has a right, socially, to maintain the non-transparent diplomatic \"front\" that is the testimonial condition. In terms of his \"international theme,\" James sees this right as taken for granted in Europe, whereas American culture is more likely to demand from an individual the perpetual \"transparency\" championed by the eighteenth-century sentimentalists.",

It is not precisely a voice of the unconscious “because it is a function of the signifier, located within language itself,” and operates beyond the control or instigation of anything at the level of the symbolic. The textual voice is primarily disruptive of the authorial voice,“which consciously appeals to reason and emotions.” Challenging “the construction of clear meaning,” the function of the textual voice is to “sublimate effects when they threaten to overwhelm character, narrator, author alike, and therefore readers too”(35–36).\nThese disturbances emerge primarily through competitions of voice and genre within the …",

While many of the technological advancements in recent decades have been of tremendous benefit, some have created new forms of hazards for the safety and health of mankind. As a result, safety and health issues have played a key role in many fields of engineering and engineering technology. This is especially true in the Biomedical Engineering field whose growth rate has outpaced other traditional engineering disciplines in recent years. In the health care industry, patient safety and health issues lead to many injuries and death with resulting litigation every year. Even though the importance of health and safety considerations is well established for many fields of engineering, it is not taught as an integral part of most engineering or engineering technology curricula, and is not tested as part of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) or Professional Engineering (PE) licensing exams 1. The recognized importance of safety and health in engineering, however, has led to the development of relatively new degrees in Safety Engineering. The Electrical Engineering Technology (EET) program at Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) has recently instituted an option in Biomedical Engineering Technology (BMET). Recognizing the inherent hazards to health and safety in the medical environment, a required course in Health Care Safety was included in the curriculum.

This is especially true for those educational institutions that offer programs in the engineering technologies, engineering, and computer related fields. Since the graduates from these institutions form the pool of new employees for industry, it is important that industry contributes ideas on the preparation of the graduates. Industry constantly functions at the cutting edge of technology. As such, it can be expected that suggestions from industry will be based on the current technological applications. In order for graduates to be sufficiently well prepared for the workplace, they will need to be instructed on the latest developments in industry. It is for these reasons that many programs utilize Industrial Advisory Committees who can provide an industrial perspective to the institutions. These committees form an essential component to the administration of academic programs. Due to, the more complex nature of the telecommunications equipment these days, the current industry requirement calls for a change of emphasis in the preparation of graduates. While they still need to understand the equipment in terms of how they function and how to assemble them, it has become paramount that the graduates are proficient in operating the equipment.

Recent and ongoing advances in communication technology, has led to an explosion in distance delivery methods and techniques. This has provided academic institutions with the much-needed opportunity to reach remote audiences with their program offerings.\nA review of established distance delivery techniques reveals that compressed video and the use of the Internet are the most prevalent techniques employed by academic institutions throughout the nation. In the case of delivering highly technical content, it appears that interactive classroom instruction is still the preferred means of delivery. As a result, the Engineering Technology Division at Florida A&M University (FAMU) has chosen to use compressed video with taped backup in an interactive instructional setting as the preferred means of delivering its technical courses to its satellite campuses around the state of Florida. This paper presents the experiences gained at FAMU in delivering a course in computer-aided circuit analysis to students at one of its satellite campus through distance delivery. Some of the issues encountered (technical as well as non-technical) will be discussed.",

In recent times, information has become a commodity that all people require in their professional lives, for entertainment as well as personal use. More and more educational institutions and libraries are employing computers to facilitate their activities in educational scholarship. Factors such as these establish the functionality of the computer as an essential requirement in the lives of all people who need to use information. The context of digital divide focuses on the separation between those who have easy access to computer facilities and those who do not. It is established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that minorities, low-income persons, the less educated and children of single-parent household are some of those who are most affected by the lack of access to information resources particularly when they reside in rural areas or central cities. It can be argued that these are some of the very parties who need such facilities for personal development. The digital divide is thus a gulf that must be bridged if there is to be some form of equity in the aspirations of all people in the society. With many academic institutions now requiring that their students each own a computer as a basic tool for use during their college education, this paper will attempt to examine the impact of such requirements on minority students, students from low-income families, and those who are attempting to work and pay their own way through college.",

Utilizing Short Message Service (SMS), the system promptly notifies users about incoming mail, providing details on the sender, type of correspondence, and content to enhance security. Unlike existing systems, SMA-01 overcomes limitations such as limited use, low reliability in low light conditions, and lack of recipient identification. The hardware support involves an infrared module, RFID reader, and GSM module powered by a 9V battery. Successful experiments on various mailboxes validate its effectiveness. The software support includes libraries for serial communication, SPI, and RFID. SMA-01 represents a significant leap in secure and efficient mail handling. Future improvements include compact design and support for envelopes.[1] In the era of widespread internet use, especially post-COVID-19, Thailand has witnessed a surge in mobile banking and e-commerce, emphasizing the need for efficient parcel delivery. To address the issue of missed deliveries and potential losses, this study introduces a solarpowered smart parcel box utilizing IoT technology. The system, combining Node MCU ESP8266, infrared sensors, and a LINE application, ensures timely alerts to recipients via a mobile app. Unlike previous works, this prototype harnesses clean energy, marking a significant research gap.

The research conducted in the VIP-BAT EEG lab aims to gather, analyze and interpret data, and draw conclusions on the study of Attention and Distraction. Using volunteer participants, these experiments focus on how brain waves correlate with results from gameplay and with external factors influencing the outcomes. When gathering data on attention and distraction, participants engage in several mini-games, with their environment changing each round. Specifically, in data capturing, EMOTIV hardware and software are used for wave capturing and MATLAB is used to process the data in graphical form to identify noticeable impacts. Referring to the experimental data helps create understanding of how the brain and body react to these events simultaneously. The results of this research will help in addressing a wide range of issues, from assisting a student with studying, to potentially saving a life.",

Though we have various renewable energy sources, the perfect one to use as an energy source for vehicles is hydrogen. Like electricity, hydrogen is an energy carrier that has the ability to deliver incredible amounts of energy. Onboard hydrogen storage in vehicles is an important factor that should be considered when designing fuel cell vehicles. In this study, a recent development in hydrogen fuel cell engines is reviewed to scrutinize the feasibility of using hydrogen as a major fuel in transportation systems. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that can produce electricity by allowing chemical gases and oxidants as reactants. With anodes and electrolytes, the fuel cell splits the cation and the anion in the reactant to produce electricity. Fuel cells use reactants, which are not harmful to the environment and produce water as a product of the chemical reaction. As hydrogen is one of the most efficient energy carriers, the fuel cell can produce direct current (DC) power to run the electric car. By integrating a hydrogen fuel cell with batteries and the control system with strategies, one can produce a sustainable hybrid car.",

          "abstract": "Offshore wind energy is a sustainable renewable energy source that is acquired by harnessing the force of the wind offshore, where the absence of obstructions allows the wind to travel at higher and more steady speeds. Offshore wind has recently grown in popularity because wind energy is more powerful offshore than on land. Prior to the development of floating structures, wind turbines could not be deployed in particularly deep or complicated seabed locations since they were dependent on fixed structures. With the advent of floating structures, which are moored to the seabed using flexible anchors, chains, or steel cables, wind turbines can now be placed far offshore. The deployment of floating wind turbines in deep waters is encouraged by several benefits, including steadier winds, less visual impact, and flexible acoustic noise requirements. A thorough understanding of the physics underlying the dynamic response of the floating offshore wind turbines, as well as various design principles and analysis methods, is necessary to fully compete with traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels. The present work offers a comprehensive review of the most recent state-of-the-art developments in the offshore wind turbine technology, including aerodynamics, hydromechanics, mooring, ice, and inertial loads. The existing design concepts and numerical models used to simulate the complex wind turbine dynamics are also presented, and their capabilities and limitations are discussed in detail.",

Soft robots are made of materials that have comparable modulus of elasticity to that of biological systems. Several advantages of soft robots over rigid robots are safe human interaction, ease of adaptation with wearable electronics and simpler gripping. We review design factors of soft robots including modeling, controls, actuation, fabrication and application, as well as their limitations and future work. For modeling, we survey kinematic, multibody and numerical finite element methods. Finite element methods are better suited for the analysis of soft robots, since they can accurately model nonlinearities in geometry and materials. However, their real-time integration with controls is challenging. We categorize the controls of soft robots as model-based and model-free.

Aerodynamic interaction between the turbines causes sub-optimal energy production. A control strategy to mitigate these losses is by redirecting the wake by yaw misalignment. This paper aims to assess the influence of load variations of the rotor due to partial wake overlap and presents a combined optimization of the power and loads using wake redirection. For this purpose, we design a computational framework which computes the wind farm power production and the wind turbine rotor loads based on the yaw settings. The simulation results show that partial wake overlap can significantly increase asymmetric loading of the rotor disk and that yaw misalignment is beneficial in situations where the wake can be sufficiently directed away from the downstream turbine.",

One way to achieve this, is to reduce the uncertainty in wave load calculations by using a more advanced model for wave kinematics. As offshore wind turbines are generally sited in shallow water, nonlinear effects which results in steeper waves with higher velocities and accelerations are common. Whereas extreme waves are modeled with higher-order nonlinear regular wave models, fatigue loads are calculated from kinematics obtained by a lowfidelity linear irregular wave model. In this paper, a second-order wave model that is employed to simulate the dynamic response due to nonlinear irregular waves on a full set of IEC-standard load cases. This method is computationally efficient, which is particularly useful for design optimization studies. It is shown that by using this method for a 25 m deep site in the German Bight, equivalent fatigue loads increase by 7.5% compared to the traditional linear wave model. The effect of nonlinear waves on fatigue is most prevalent in the foundation and tower parts near the sea surface. Furthermore, it is found that the increase in fatigue damage accumulation is most prevalent in wind-wave misaligned load cases, in which aerodynamic damping is absent.",

To do any aeroelastic simulation, the structural properties of the blade such as stiffnesses and mass per unit length should be known in advance, and extracting these properties is a difficult task. This paper presents an analytical model to extract these structural properties in a simple way. It starts with calculating an equivalent material property of the cross section using weighting method. Then the centroid of each section is obtained. Next the second moment of inertia of each element relevant to its local coordinates system is calculated and transferred to the centroid of the section using parallel axis theorem. A coordinate transformation is employed to rotate these second moment of inertias around any arbitrary axis. Finally, flapwise and edgewise stiffnesses are found by multiplying the equivalent modulus of elasticity to the second area moment of inertia in each section. Mass per unit length is calculated by multiplying the equivalent density to the real area of each section. The method is verified with the structural properties of a commercial 660 kW wind turbine blade. Despite the simplicity of the method the results show a good agreement.",

A computational model is developed to characterize the physics of the wind farm wake, aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads, response of the support structure to these loads, soil-structure interaction, as well as different cost elements. Levelized cost of energy is introduced as the objective function. The design constraints are the farm external boundary, and support structure buckling, first modal-frequency, fatigue damage and ultimate stresses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four optimization scenarios are considered: a feasible baseline design, optimization of layout only, optimization of support structure only, and integrated design of the layout and support structure.

To do that, the controller design is automated and integrated with an aeroelastic simulation tool. This integrated tool is linked with an optimization engine. The automated controller has two built-in control algorithms; a generator-torque controller and an above rated pitch-controller. This new tool is used in the DOP of the 5MW NREL research wind turbine. To show how this method works some parameters of both the generatortorque controller and the pitch-controller are introduced as design variables in the DOP. As the result of changing controller related design variables within each optimization iteration, the values of the objective function and the design constraint also change. This shows that by introducing the controller’s parameters as design variables in the DOP a more realistic assessment of the objective function and constraints is possible that helps the optimizer to search for better solutions.",

We demonstrate that this birefringence results in complex caustics patterns for a circular gate, selective focusing of different spins, and the possible direct measurement of the Rashba coupling strength in scanning-probe experiments.",

An effective Hamiltonian that describes different symmetry-breaking terms in graphene, while preserving time-reversal invariance, shows that an inverted mass band-gap regime is possible. The competition of different perturbation terms causes a transition from an inverted mass phase to a staggered gap in the bilayer heterostructure as seen in its phase diagram. A tight-binding calculation of the bilayer validates the effective model parameters. A relative gate voltage between the layers may produce such a phase transition in experimentally accessible systems.

Here, we report the observation of resonance states in photoswitchable self-assembled molecular(SAM)-graphene hybrid.

However, the absence of an energy gap made graphene not immediately suitable to be implemented in optoelectronic devices.

We present an analysis of scattering by defects in graphene in the presence of spin-orbit interactions (SOIs).

We show that SOIs lead to a drastic decrease of this ratio, especially at low carrier concentrations, while the scattering becomes increasingly isotropic. As the strength of the SOI determines the energy (carrier concentration) where this drop is more evident, this effect could help evaluate these interactions through transport measurements in graphene systems with enhanced spin-orbit coupling.",

Using Keldysh-Floquet Green's functions, we develop a theoretical framework to calculate the time-averaged RKKY coupling under weak periodic drives, and we show that its magnitude in undoped graphene can be decreased controllably by increasing the driving strength, while mostly maintaining its ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic character.

Based on a symmetry analysis of the scattering matrix, we show that if the spatial distribution of multiple potential scatterers breaks mirror symmetry about the axis of incoming electrons, then a splitting of the current between two valleys is observed. This leads to the appearance of the valley Hall effect. We illustrate the effect of mirror-symmetry breaking in a minimal system of two symmetric impurities, demonstrating the splitting between valleys via the differential cross sections and nonvanishing skew parameter. We further discuss the role that these effects may play in transport experiments.",

For the [111]-grown heterostructure, SE-TI interface states exhibit elliptical contours of constant energy and complex spin textures with broken helicity, in contrast to the well-studied helical Dirac surface states. We derive a general effective Hamiltonian for SE-TI junctions, and propose experimental signatures such as an out of plane spin accumulation under a transport current and the opening of a spectral gap that depends on the direction of an applied in-plane magnetic field.",

We show that conductance of a gated double junction at the surface of a topological insulator exhibits oscillations and a quasi-linear decay as a function of gate voltage in different regimes.

For chiral spin-triplet parent SCs, we find that nodal proximity-induced superconductivity emerges when there is broken twofold rotational symmetry which forces the spins of the nonhelical topological states to tilt away from the interface plane.

Our analysis of the time-averaged polarization function and dielectric function reveals that Floquet driving modifies the screened impurity potential in two main regimes. In the weak drive regime, the time-averaged screened potential exhibits unconventional Friedel oscillations with multiple spatial periods contributed by a principal period modulated by higher-order periods, which are due to the emergence of additional Kohn anomalies in the polarization function. In the strong drive regime, the time-averaged impurity potential becomes almost unscreened and does not exhibit Friedel oscillations. This tunable Friedel oscillations is a result of the dynamic gating effect of the time-dependent driving field on the two-dimensional electron system.",

The FIS is also found to help recover from the infeasible design space rapidly. The effectiveness of the improved algorithm is demonstrated by solving a welded beam design problem and a two part stamping optimization problem.

Engineers on one hand are good critical thinkers but on the other often lack in communication and interpersonal skills. This lack of interpersonal and communication skills may be attributed to the lack of importance given to these disciplines during their engineering education. In this paper, we analyze the importance of humanities in engineering curriculum. Emphasis on liberal arts and humanities can prepare engineers to fulfill their cultural and civic responsibilities. For an engineering educator, it is vital to inculcate in the engineering students, the importance of studying humanities that can open up their minds to the use of creative ideas from great minds outside of science. Humanists claim that the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge techniques that engineers learn in their college curriculum have a limited shelf life. If they master the humanities, it can provide tools for extending that shelf life. One of the most important aspects of engineering is effective communication, both verbal and written.

          "abstract": "The need to reliably solve large structural design optimization problems in a reasonable time frame naturally leads to the investigation of the scope of parallel processing in optimization. Parallel optimization may be approached in two general ways. First, the analysis could be the target of parallel processing specially if it is significantly large compared with the overall computation. The second approach is the parallel implementation of the optimization algorithm, which can then be easily adapted for solving any appropriately formulated optimization problem. In this work the basics of parallel computer architectures and some popular parallelization strategies are described. Simulated annealing (SA), a stochastic, discrete optimization technique, is chosen for its global capability, robustness, and suitability for parallel processing. The concept of\" shakeup\" in SA, which simulates re-annealing, is introduced. The …",

Some specific research has been devoted to augment the convergence and related behavior of annealing algorithms by modifying its parameters, otherwise known as cooling schedule.

However, current literature does not provide clear conclusions whether enforcing an attendance policy actually improves student performance. This study explores student and faculty perceptions regarding the utility of attendance policies in undergraduate courses at a polytechnic university. Anonymous surveys were completed by 89 faculty members and 455 responses from five schools (Engineering, Engineering Technology and Management, Computer and Software Engineering, Architecture, and Arts and Sciences) on a single campus. Comparisons between theperceptions of students and faculty members are presented, as are comparisons between theperceptions of lower-level and upper-level students. Variations in perceptions based on major arealso highlighted. Finally, trends in perceptions regarding attendance policies in lower-level versus upper-level undergraduate courses are revealed. Students, regardless of major, class standing, or course level, reported attending more classes in courses that had attendance policies. The most significant impact of an attendance policy on class attendance was observed at the freshman level. While 84% of freshmen reported attending at least 90% of the classes in a course with an attendance policy, only 67% reported attending at that rate in a course without one. Qualitative data containing student and faculty attitudes towards attendance policies are also analyzed and discussed. Even though class attendance appeared to have …",

          "abstract": "A typical Fluid Mechanics laboratory includes various laboratory equipment and instruments to cover standard topics. However laboratories may not include a hydrostatic device, assuming it is so straight forward that it does not warrant a laboratory instrument or a laboratory exercise. As part of the senior design class a group of students wanted to design and build a Fluid Statics device that will clearly verify the static force and buoyancy theories of fluids. An idea from the Internet was used to design such a device. It was then built and tested for measuring fluid static force and buoyancy. The device worked pretty satisfactorily and the authors decided to include it as a regular laboratory experiment in the Fluid Mechanics course. The students were able to use the device easily to verify the hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy theories within a respectable margin of error. Student learning and satisfaction were measured by specifically designed survey instruments which indicate good comprehension of the topics. Some dissatisfaction with the accuracy and repeatability of measurements were indicated by the students. These would be the target for improvement in the next version of the apparatus. This paper describes the design and operation of the device as well as teaching modules and user surveys to match the results with laboratory outcomes. Such an inexpensive but functional apparatus can enhance a traditional undergraduate fluids laboratory. Student learning was positive after using it for a laboratory exercise. Included drawings and teaching modules may benefit other faculty members who want to take advantage of the current design.",

Many students find undergraduate research as a tryout for potential graduate studies, as well as a way to establish relationship with research faculty. Albeit new in our Mechanical Engineering Technology department, two students were selected to participate in a research involving defects in composite materials. These students did have minimal background in composites from the general Engineering Materials course. These minority students were supported by summer scholarships from Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP). The issue of defects and their effect on the mechanical properties of composites is of great concern among high end users. A limited set of experimental investigation with defective composite flat panels was selected for investigation. One of our adjunct faculty offered access to his fabrication facility and guidance to the students for fabricating these ‘defective’panels. Three types of defects were incorporated: hole as a discontinuity, edge groove simulating transverse crack, and Teflon interlayer simulating delamination. Once the panels were fabricated, strips were cut out for testing. Students also learned special processes for cutting and drilling composites. Aluminum tabs ware glued to the ends of the composite strips to facilitate gripping by tensile tester. Two main testing methods were employed: tensile and 3-point bending.

While over 5.6 million such commercial trailer trucks are registered in the country and with increasing diesel fuel prices, it is more important than ever to study their aerodynamics, redesign for reducing aerodynamic drag and help make these ‘big rigs’ more fuel efficient. Aerodynamic drag is the force that acts on a solid object moving in air due to difference in dynamic pressure developed around that object. Skin friction also causes resistance force which is small compared to pressure induced drag.

In this respect, the major challenges we envision are 1) to achieve occupancy monitoring in a minimally intrusive way, e.g., using the existing infrastructure in the buildings and not requiring installation of any apps in the users' smart devices, and 2) to develop effective data fusion techniques for improving occupancy monitoring accuracy using a multitude of sources.

In this study, we design a deep convolutional neural network architecture for categorizing hurricanes based on intensity using graphics processing unit.

Focal stacking is a technique of creating a single focused image from a stack of images collected with different depths of field.

To reduce the high bandwidth requirement of video streaming, videos are compressed by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancy, thus yielding dependencies among frames as well as within a frame. Unnecessary transmission and maintenance of useless packets in the buffers cause further loss and degrade the quality of delivery (QoD) significantly. In this paper, we propose a QoD‐aware hop system that can decide when and which packets could be dropped without degrading QoD. Moreover, the transmission of useless packets causes network congestion and vain payment by the wireless system subscriber.

They are widely used in wireless packet-switching networks and mobile communications. The major difference of multimedia networks from traditional networks is the deadline to display or (play) the arriving packets. Especially, this is more obvious in realtime video streaming applications. Real-time video streaming applications prefer User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for video packet transfers. The operation of sequential decoding in this paper is applied on wireless multimedia networks. Buffers are usually required by the sequential decoder to store packets if there is an empty space. Geometric/Pareto/1/N queue model is used to describe the behavior of the sequential decoders with finite buffers. In this paper, we present an analytical study on the finite buffer behaviors of the sequential decoding system and provide closed form expression for the blocking probability due to limited buffer capacity, system throughput, and average buffer occupancy. We present also a simulation study to show the average buffer occupancy.",

          "abstract": "In image thresholding problems, there are some cases that single thresholding technique may not generate good binary images for all samples. Using multiple methods may help to overcome this limitation, but this idea brings another problem. It is not a trivial task to select proper thresholding method for each image in the dataset. In this study, we propose a generic framework for image thresholding that utilizes a tree based structure to determine the best thresholding approach for a particular case. We call our method “DT-Binarize,” and apply our method to the protein crystallization image dataset. In our experiments, we compare the results with the reference binary images that are manually generated by our research group. In order to provide more reliable and objective comparison, numerical results are presented as well as the visual results. Experimental results indicate that the correctness of DT-Binarize …",

          "abstract": "The most important components of multimedia networking are video streaming and synchronization. In video networking, the frames are split into smaller packets at the application layer. The packets of a frame are assembled before being processed at the receiver. For realtime video streaming, packet acknowledgments and retransmission are not practical. When congestion occurs, some packets may be dropped. Consequently, the entire frame (and sometimes successive frames in a group) is considered lost (ie, not displayable). Often a loss of one packet from the frame can lead to a loss of the whole frame. Selective Message Discarding Policies have been proposed to reduce or avoid congestion and achieve a better buffer utilization by discarding all packets that do not belong to good messages. In this paper, these discarding policies are studied and applied for MPEG video data transmission. Our queuing …",

In this vein, blockchain technology has received a substantial interest in the last decade as it provides trust among users without a trusted third party, which enabled a myriad of applications. To this end, we propose a framework that utilizes blockchain technology to verify integrity of a camera footage recorded by a resource‐constrained wireless Internet of Things (IoT) device. The proposed approach computes the hash of the video data before it leaves the IoT device to ensure the integrity. The hash is then stored on a permissioned blockchain platform that enables detection of tampering in the video. The continuous stream is segmented efficiently to have …",

In this paper, we propose an experimental design method called “Associative Experimental Design $(AED)$” and an optimization method includes eliminating prohibited combinations and prioritizing reagents based on $AED$ analysis of results from protein crystallization experiments. $AED$ generates candidate cocktails based on these initial screening results. These results are analyzed to determine those screening factors in chemical space that are most likely to lead to higher scoring outcomes, crystals. We have …",

The usage of PRNU in distinguishing cameras across different manufacturers and models has proven to be successful; however, we demonstrate that current approaches fail to distinguish cameras amongst the same manufacturers and models. As such, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm that focuses on emphasizing the pixels that contribute to the sensor noise in the PRNU pattern to distinguish cameras of the same type.

In order to deal with the forensic implications of social networks, current research on both digital forensics and social networks need to be incorporated and understood. This will help digital forensics investigators to predict, detect and even prevent any criminal activities in different forms. It will also help researchers to develop new models/techniques in the future. This paper provides literature review of the social network forensics methods, models, and techniques in order to provide an overview to the researchers for their future works as well as the law enforcement investigators for their investigations when crimes are committed in the cyber space. It also provides awareness and defense methods for OSN users in order to protect them against to social attacks.",

Therefore, the next natural question would be to study the asymptotic behavior of the error and construct asymptotically optimal sequences of partitions.

The first results on exact inequalities of the type (1) were obtained by Landau [3] for q= p= s=∞, k= 1, and r= 2. A survey of subsequent results on exact inequalities of the types (1) and (2) can be found in [4].

The value of the unit price bid is one of the leading indicators to comprehensively reflect the cost to the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) for these projects. Compared with other cost index research, the changing trend and large volatility of unit price bids make the prediction more difficult. This research proposes a robust ensemble learning model to predict the value of unit price bids. Data on bidding prices for more than 1,400 projects in the past nine years, along with 57 related variables, are collected, and 20 of them are selected by Boruta feature analysis to train and test the model. The results are compared with those from a baseline Monte Carlo simulation and a multiple linear regression model. Comparison shows that the proposed ensemble learning …",

This is a critical problem for state highway agencies that strive to develop more accurate cost estimates, deliver projects within the budget, and optimize constrained funds for their highway programs. This inaccuracy problem is a temporal issue since the engineer’s estimate is developed ahead of time before the project is advertised and bids are received. The question that transportation agencies are interested in finding an answer to is: are there any significant risk factors in the construction market indicating to the increased likelihood of the deviation between owner’s estimate and the submitted low bid?

However, few empirical studies are focused on analyzing the low bid deviation. Thus, the objective of this research is to identify factors affecting the low bid deviation from the agency’s engineer’s estimate. To achieve this objective, this study uses several important variables with the potential to explain the deviation, for example, variables representing project characteristics and market condition factors. Historical cost information for highway construction projects let in the State of Louisiana between 2011 and 2015 are utilized to build the explanatory model. Logit regression analysis is conducted for measuring the effects of influential factors on the low bid deviation. The results of this study indicate that the competition of bidding process, the number of activities in the contract, crude oil price, and value of construction put in place of pavement projects have significant impacts on the low bid deviation. This study contributes to the body of knowledge through the creation of a logit regression model that provides valuable insights into significant factors impacting the low bid deviation. It is anticipated that transportation professionals benefit from the findings of this research to develop more accurate bids and making reliable investment decisions for highway projects.",

The overarching objective of this study is to explain variation in the submitted unit price bids for asphalt line items used in highway projects. The study applies geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to explore spatial variations of relationships between submitted unit price bids and explanatory variables and to create a set of local models with the capability to describe variations in submitted unit price bids. The regression analysis of submitted unit prices for asphalt line items, drawn from in highway pavement projects in the state of Georgia between 2008 and 2015, examines key variables, including the quantity of the bid item, the total contract price, the number of bids, the dollar value of a project, and the price index of asphalt cement. The results indicate significant spatial variation in the relationship between submitted unit price bid and the identified explanatory variables. Not only is GWR analysis capable of more accurately describing variation in submitted unit price bids, but it also provides a means of exploring the geographical variation of construction costs in a graphical manner.",

As the construction market and economy have experienced dynamic changes in prices, the price volatility becomes less predictable. In addition, various levels of the price volatility in different market locations aggravate the prediction. Thus, in developing highway construction costs, transportation agencies should consider geographical location of construction projects and market conditions of the locations. Transportation agencies face significant uncertainties in price volatility across different geographical locations. This volatility may not be uniformly distributed across different geographical locations due to changes in the availability of local contractors, materials, equipment, and labor.

Through an extensive literature review and interviews with subject-matter experts in different functional groups in GDOT and the project management team in the Office of Program Delivery, the total of 21 major areas of project issues were determined for the 5 major offices (i.e., Offices of Environmental Services, Right-of-Way, Strategic Communication, Utilities, and Bridge Design) and 125 risk factors were identified for the major areas of the project issues. The findings of the research report provide a searchable and customizable risk identification that can aid project managers in evaluating the existing conditions and related issues of the project early in the concept- and scope-development phases of the PDP. The primary contribution of this research is to enhance the ability of state transportation agencies to understand existing project conditions and potential project risks that adversely affect the smooth delivery of the project.",

To estimate prices for LS pay items, cost estimators and designers in state DOTs apply engineering judgment using knowledge from similar projects from the past and reach out to subject matter experts for providing additional resources. However, researching similar projects for finding appropriate estimates for the LS pay item is not a simple endeavor and leads to significant inaccuracy of cost estimates. A need exists to develop new methods that are capable of capturing key information from project documents and incorporating the complex nonlinear relationships between input and output variables in developing prediction models for LS pay item prices for highway projects. Thus, the overarching objective of this research is to develop forecasting models to estimate the prices of the Traffic Control and Grading Complete LS pay items using advanced text mining and machine learning algorithms that detect key patterns of information generated during project development and provide higher accuracy in cost estimates. In this research, a forecasting model for the prices of the Traffic Control and Grading Complete LS pay items was developed using machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest, bagging, k-nearest neighbors, and stacking regressor).

This study explores the conceptions of Muslim Americans regarding mental illness. Two hundred and fifty-five individuals identifying as Muslim American participated in a mixed-method anonymous survey. The results of the survey reveal that most Muslim American participants adhere primarily to the dominant Western biomedical model of mental illness, but open-ended responses reflect a more complex understanding of mental illness as having biological, environmental, and psycho-spiritual origins. Findings suggest that how a Muslim American interprets mental illness will most likely depend upon the symptoms and context of the illness. Further exploration is needed to understand the beliefs of Muslim Americans and the way in which these beliefs affect attitudes toward therapies and mental health services.",

Two hundred and fifty five Muslim Americans completed a scale designed to assess two aspects of acculturation within the population: adherence to Islamic identity and conformity to American social norms. The survey was distributed in both a paper-based and online anonymous format consisting of demographic questions and the acculturation scale designed for this study. Results revealed that both immigrants and U.S. born Muslim Americans demonstrate a strong adherence to their Islamic identity and low levels of conformity to American social norms. American-born Muslims scored significantly lower on conformity to American social norms than immigrant Muslims. Study findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that Muslim Americans are less likely to sacrifice religious values to assimilate. Specific item results provide insight into what aspects of American culture Muslims are more willing to adopt, and which they are likely to shun. These findings demonstrate the challenges Muslim Americans face integrating in an increasingly hostile host culture.",

The second strongest correlate was participants’ perceived severity of COVID-19 across the United States. Perceived effectiveness of recommended practices accounted for the largest variance in behavioral intention. However, analysis of individual behaviors indicated a mismatch in the behaviors perceived to be the most effective (avoiding sick people and mask-wearing) and those participants indicated intention to engage in (throwing away used tissues, avoiding sick people, and coughing into their elbows) in the next 30 days.\nConclusions: The authors recommend tailoring public health messaging to address the perceived threat of COVID-19 and …",

The high genetic variability of HBV and HCV genome is reflected by eight genotypes (A to H) and six genotypes (1 to 6), respectively. Each genotype has a characteristic geographical distribution, which is important epidemiologically. Previous studies from the province of Sindh, Pakistan have reported that genotypes D and A as well as D and B are prevalent HBV genotypes, and for HCV genotypes 3a and 3b to be dominant. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of co-infection of both HBV and HCV genotypes in physically healthy females at two universities in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan and HBV diagnosed patients41, 42, 56-59.\nMethodology: Blood was collected from a total of 4000 healthy female volunteer students and 28 HBV diagnosed patients. Serum samples obtained were screened for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBs antibodies and anti-HCV antibodies by immunochromatography and ELISA. Genotyping was carried out for 6 HBV genotypes (A through F) and 6 HCV genotypes (1 through 6). Genotyping data of HBV and HCV positive individuals are described.\nResults: Out of 4028 volunteers, 172 (4.3%) tested positive for HBsAg. All 172 serum samples were genotyped by PCR for both HBV and HCV. Out of 172 HBsAg positive samples, 89 (51.7%) showed a single HBV genotype D infection, followed by genotypes A (6.4%), F (4.6%), B (3.5%), E (1.7%), and C (1.7%).

We begin the chapter by providing an overview of the sacred texts from several major world religions, with a focus on Christianity, Islam, and Judaism because these are religions that we are more familiar with.

In particular, the study focuses on terrorism in Middle Eastern and North African (MENAP) countries and features terrorism incident count data for the period 1998–2012 using negative binomial regression models. In our exogenous model, we find that while youth unemployment tends to increase domestic terrorism, it does not have any significant effect on transnational terrorism. Given concerns about endogeneity of youth unemployment in these models, we use two kinds of corrections-instrumental variables and lagged variables. We control for endogeneity by using military expenditure, under-five mortality rate and foreign direct investment as instruments. We are not able to reject the null hypothesis that youth unemployment is exogenous. Using lagged …",

We determine the optimal allocation of resources between these two strategies wherein we model the role of intelligence using the concept of supermodular precision. One striking result is that under certain circumstances, an increase in the investment in intelligence can induce a more devious terrorist to attack with a higher probability. We also find that when there is a cost-reducing innovation in the screening technology, then the optimal investment in intelligence gathering can go either way.

We consider the experience of 129 countries during the period 1998–2012 to determine the effect of a natural disaster on both domestic as well as transnational terrorism. We also control for endogeneity using expenditure on health care and land area in a country as instruments. In contrast to the existing literature, we measure the extent of terrorism by the value of property damage. The results indicate that after natural disasters, (a) transnational terrorism increases with a lag, and (b) a statistically significant impact on domestic terrorism is not observed.",

In equilibrium, the government sets the standard of the program at a level that minimizes congestion. However, the optimal espionage expenditure is less than the level that minimizes congestion.

We analyze the problem using a game between a government, an infrastructural firm, and an attacker. If the attacker successfully breaches the IT security defenses of the infrastructural firm, primary losses accrue to that firm, while widespread collateral losses accrue to the rest of the economy. The government assists the infrastructural firm by providing intelligence inputs about an impending attack. We find that subject to some conditions, expenditure on intelligence adds value only when its amount exceeds a threshold level. Also, the nature of the equilibrium depends on the level of government expenditure in intelligence. We find that the optimal level of intelligence expenditure can change in seemingly unexpected ways in response to a shift in parameters. For example, reduced vulnerability of the infrastructural …",

Using a two period model we show that the net impact on deviant behavior to changes in unemployment can go either way depending upon the nature of the equilibrium. Two kinds of equilibria are possible. In one, a non-deviant’s probability of being employed increases as expected market conditions improve which lowers the incentive to be a deviant. In contrast, in the other kind of equilibrium, the deviant’s probability of being employed increases when market conditions improve which increases the incentive to be a deviant. In either case, there is a setup cost to deviant behavior and the attractiveness of incurring that increases with an increase in expected probability …",

These results contrast with previous research which finds that transnational terrorism primarily affects these economic indicators.

Our main conclusion is that CON laws by and large enhanced competition in the inpatient market during the period of our study. This indicates that the effects of CON laws to hinder predatory behavior could dominate its effects of preventing new entrants into the inpatient care market. We do not find statistically significant evidence to reject the exogeneity assumption of either CON laws or their stringency in our study.

Three pure strategy equilibria exist in the game. When the ex post value of winning is small, all players fight in equilibrium. However, when the ex post value of winning is large, in equilibrium either sponsors 1 and 2 coordinate their actions, with one of them staying out of the contest, or sponsor 3 does not participate.

          "abstract": "Take the fort, then take the city. In a two-stage, two-party contest, victory in the initial stage can provide an advantage in the final stage. We examine such momentum in conflict scenarios and investigate how valuable it must be to avoid a Pyrrhic victory. Our main finding is that although the elasticity of effort—which we allow to vary between the two stages—does impact the contestants’ effort levels, it has no bearing on the endogenously determined value of momentum itself. Further, rent dissipation in the two-stage conflict is equal across party whether or not an individual obtains first-stage momentum. Thus, momentum helps a player solely by enhancing marginal ability for victory in the second-stage contest. It does not, however, change the player’s net calculus of secondstage contest spending. Such contestable advantage is also found to be more rent-dissipative than innate/uncontestable advantage. Therefore, Pyrrhic victories should be more common for contests with an intermediate stage or stages in which advantages can be earned, ceteris paribus. While intermediate targets appear as useful conflict benchmarks, they dissipate additional expected contest rents. This additional rent-dissipative toll exists even for backward-inductive equilibrium behavior in a complete information setting. Whereas the quagmire theory suggests parties can become involved in problematic conflicts due to incomplete information, the present paper finds that the setting of conflict—namely, contestable intermediate advantage—can alternatively generate rent-dissipative tolls. Similarly, contestable advantage can lead parties to optimally forego contest participation …",

There has been less emphasis on scholarly composing with comics (some notable exceptions include Scott Mc-Cloud s celebrated Understanding Comics and Nick Sousanis's recently pub-lished dissertation, Unflattening). If youll excuse the irony of writing on such a topic in an alphabetic format, I suggest that fusions between comics and scholarship can (1) fruitfully challenge definitions of scholarly genres,(2) offer resources for designing arguments in digital environments, and (3) invite all who practice scholarly composing to reflect critically upon their mediating decisions.\nMessy Genres In …",

The series has connections to many different genres and narrative traditions within the realm of folkloristics. However, the folkloric genre most relevant to the ethos and aesthetics of Madoka is that of the fairy tale. Drawing on Bill Ellis’s concept of “fairy-telling” and scholarship on new media composition, in this paper we seek to investigate labyrinths as acts of embodied composing—not lairs of evil or destruction but rather creative material memory work that negotiates grief and despair. Many of the series’ action sequences unfold in “labyrinths,” the magical spaces controlled by witches. By composing a labyrinth, witches can simultaneously reshape their environment and create a powerful statement about identity through personalized performance in narrative spaces that they control. In particular, we argue that both the frameworks of “fairy tale” and “new media” give us useful analytical resources for beginning to make sense of the intricately complex phenomenon of Madoka’s labyrinths.",

I close with suggestions for how a vernacular approach to religion might intersect fruitfully with approaches to literacy that take into account both multiple cultural contexts and multiple media forms.

Furthermore, comics make it possible to represent ethnographic human data in ways that both intimately present and distance themselves from human subjects while making the researcher-creator’s interpretive lens unmistakably visible to avoid any illusions of unbiased objectivity. Additionally, digital environments make it possible to embed additional ethnographic data, such as audio or video, and also to improve accessibility through descriptive alt text. This chapter will address topics including the affordances and constraints of comics as scholarship, comics …",

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship in video game design and development has taken an affective turn, asking questions about the individual and collective experiences that games engender in players. For instance, Katherine Isbister, in How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design, explores how the worlds of games extend and persist beyond a specific play-experience into social, nongame environments, claiming that game designers have come to realize that “extended play is far more meaningful when embedded in understandable human social frameworks for collective action”(2017, 123). Through these frameworks we experience sets of values in a game and learn how the systems that structure our play support or challenge them. Games allow us to explore and experiment with values, as well as to learn about the functions of those values within and beyond a game environment (see Anable 2018; Juul 2013; Sicart 2014). Values are social, cultural, technological, and/or institutional conventions, ones that can be altered with purposeful and conscientious design practices (De Koven 2013, 9).\nContributing to the increasing interest in affective game design, Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum propose a three-part method for uncovering values in games and cultivating a design practice for engaging and changing conventional values. Conscientious game design, they write, begins by acknowledging that “(1) there are common (not necessarily universal) values;(2) artifacts may embody ethical and political values; and (3) steps taken in design and development have the power to affect the nature of those values”(2014, 11). Through this recursive design …",

In the case of complex products and supply chains, this can lead to suboptimization of the supply chain system. Suboptimization may occur when the pursuit of the lowest piece price actually adds cost to the system. A systems approach to analyzing an entire supply chain to determine nonvalue-added activity—some of which is introduced through the pursuit of low-cost suppliers—can help to optimize and rationalize a supply chain and result in cost savings and efficiency improvements.",

While several valid and reliable tools to measure the components of the practice environment have been developed by nurse researchers with two measures,, the Practice Environment Scale and Job Enjoyment Scale, are included in the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators®(NDNQI®) RN Satisfaction Survey. Leiter and Lachinger (2006) posited the Nursing Worklife Model (NWLM) to explain how the elements identified are interrelated in the complex system of the nurse practice environment with subsequent work that extended the model to include association of nurse perception of patient adverse events. Further exploration of the impact of the specific elements of the practice environment on patient adverse events is needed. To date, researchers have primarily evaluated the impact of clinical outcomes using administrative data at the hospital or individual nurse level using nurse perceived adverse patient outcomes. In addition to RN Survey data, the NDNQI® provides a database of nurse-sensitive clinical outcomes (eg, urinary tract infections rates) at the unit level. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of elements of the NWLM on a measured nurse-sensitive outcome, catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) at the unit level.

Our lab uses cutting-edge statistical and mathematical tools to explore the relationships\n                     between living things and our changing world. We are primarily focused on animals,\n                     especially vertebrates like the squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and human (Homo sapiens) at right. Our research spans the real and virtual worlds: projects in the QuantEco\n                     lab involve everything from field sampling and bench science to data analysis and\n                     simulation modeling. Use the links at left to explore the lab's research. You can\n                     also find information about the courses I teach.\nIf you  are a KSU undergraduate interested in gaining field and lab research experience\n                     with animals, reach out byemailso we can discuss details. We are currently gearing up for small mammal trapping fieldwork\n                     throughout the rest of 2025 and 2026. There are many levels of involvement available,\n                     from volunteer to research for credit (BIOL3110Lor4400).\nYou can follow the lab onBluesky(@greenquanteco.bsky.social) for updates and events.\nUseful links:\nDepartment of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB)\nMaster of Science in Integrative Biology (MSIB) program\nCollege of Science and Mathematics",

    "bio": "(Source: ASM) Microbiologists work in almost every industry - from food, agriculture and pollution\n                     control to biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and health. They also work in government\n                     agencies and labs, such as the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection\n                     Agency, water treatment facilities, and hospitals. They also work in education as\n                     teachers and researchers. Because there are so many different species of microbes\n                     out there and they do such very different things, no one microbiologist can study\n                     everything! That's why people who become microbiologists usually focus on a particular\n                     microbe or research area. Here are a few examples: Some microbiologists focus on bacteria\n                     and how they help or hurt us. These scientists are called bacteriologists. Some specialize\n                     in viruses and how they infect cells. These scientists are called virologists. Some\n                     study fungi in particular and are called mycologists. Some microbiologists track down\n                     outbreaks of disease to learn what caused them and if we're facing a deadly new microbe.\n                     They are called epidemiologists. Some study how the body defends itself against microbial\n                     invaders. They are called immunologists. This is only a partial listing of the many\n                     different things microbiologists do. If you really want to get a good sense of what\n                     microbiologists do, you should talk to some of them. You might start with the microbiology\n                     researchers here at KSU - Drs. Ramya Rajagopalan, Jean Lu, Micheal Beach, Chris Cornelison,\n                     Premila Achar, Andrew Haddow, Yoshi Masafumi or myself.\nCourses\n2260/2260L Fundamental Microbiology/Fundamental Microbiology Lab4460K Medical Microbiology with Lab3301K Intro to Biotechnology3340/3340L General Microbiology/ Microbiology Lab4635 Advanced Topics in Microbiology: Deadly Microbes7446 Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis (Graduate course)\nResearch Interest\nBacterial pathogenesis\nThe opportunistic human pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosahas one of the largest and most metabolically diverse genomes among bacteria.  The\n                     Griffin lab uses molecular biology approaches from PCR to transcriptomics to investigate\n                     differential regulation by an under-reported epigenetic regulator of a large group\n                     of metabolic pathways and virulence factors.\nPathogen-Specific Phages\nAs bacterial pathogens, especially the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter\n                        baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,andEnterobacterspp.), continually develop resistance to clinical applications of standard antibiotics,\n                     rapid identification of nonchemical-antibiotic therapies are attractive for future\n                     treatment of these organisms. Bacteriophages, viruses that target bacteria, have potential\n                     uses in alternative antibiotic therapies because of their abundance in nature and\n                     their high specificity of infection. Identifying common sources of phages within the\n                     environment, especially those that can infect the ESKAPE pathogens, could reveal untapped\n                     reservoirs of phages that are easily isolated and accessible for uses in clinical\n                     settings.\nCurrent Research Students\nUndergraduates\nJosefa Wulf, Lexie Williams, Francisco Armstrong\nMSIB graduate student\nAlexis Williams\nFuture Directed Study OpportunitiesGriffin lab will be looking for new students for Fall 2025.",

    "bio": "Dr. Lawler's scholarship focuses on equity issues in mathematicseducation; in particular, the ways in which power and knowledge intertwine to govern\n                        the learner's mathematical identity. His core research examines the personal epistemologies\n                        of adolescent mathematicians: Do high school maths students see themselves as mathematical\n                        authors? This interest leads him to seek to understand the ways that students come\n                        to know the school, classroom, and teacher contexts, and how these knowings interact\n                        with their mathematical identities.\nDuring his 30+ year career as a mathematics educator, he has supported teachers, schools,\n                     and districts to de-track mathematics programs and transform teaching practices. He\n                     is a contributing author to the internationally acclaimed high school mathematics\n                     curriculum Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP).\nHis current research projects (district changeandcommunity organizing) focus upon how schools and districts transform their mathematics instruction to\n                     foreground student ways of thinking (inventions) against the backdrop of high-stakes\n                     education.\n\"One [can] teach without reinforcing existing systems of domination.\"(bell hooks, 1994)",

    "bio": "I am fascinated by phenotypic variation and how behaviors and the environment can\n                     shape our brain and immune systems. Currently I am studying nature's super-healers\n                     to understand how we can teach the human body to regenerate and recover instead of\n                     scar and atrophy. I look at healing as a whole system: not just cells and genes, but\n                     how they connect and interact with the brain, behavior, and environment.\nI started research as an undergrad, curious how babies develop handedness and using\n                     rats as a model to understand how birth affects the brain. That curiosity grew into\n                     a passion for combining animal behavior with biomedical research. I realized that\n                     behavior (think, biomechanics, movement, and brain plasticity) is often overlooked,\n                     but can be a powerful tool to understand recovery after injury.\nNow, I leadThe Varholick Lab at Kennesaw State University. Our team explores how behavior, the environment, cells, and genes work together\n                     to drive healing, regeneration, and recovery. We're always looking for curious minds\n                     and new ideas, so if you're interested in tissue regeneration and behavior, let's\n                     connect!",
