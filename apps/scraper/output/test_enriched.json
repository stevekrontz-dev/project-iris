Key notes: Dehumidification, Nighttime ventilation, Indirect Ventilation, Cooling load Introduction Traditionally, utilizing nighttime ventilation and thermal mass is a major strategy for passive cooling in dry climates. However, in moderate and humid climates, passive cooling through ventilation is more difficult to achieve. In these climates, the outside air is relatively cold during the early evening, but its relative humidity is high. Therefore, it is not suitable for nighttime ventilation. Later at night, outside relative humidity reaches the upper limit of the comfort zone, but the outside air  remains equal or more than the inside air enthalpy. Thus, introducing outside air to the space may reduce the inside air temperature without reducing the air enthalpy. Instead it could lead to more moisture absorpti",

However, there are obstacles in using this cooling strategy, including high relative humidity, pollution, limitations in the thermal storage of the building, and low nighttime air temperature.

The nighttime ventilation strategy is based on optimizing the use of direct and indirect natural ventilation through an air-to-air heat exchanger. This strategy has been tested at the Beliveau House in Blacksburg, Virginia.

The new window is similar in construction to the regular double-hung low-e windows, but can reverse its properties. In this window, the low-e coating faces the inside during the heating season, which reflects the infrared radiation to the inside. During the cooling season, the low-e coating faces the outside to reflect the outside heat. This window was tested in two test cells to evaluate its thermal performance. WINDOW5.2a software was used to predict the window thermal properties and BEANS building simulation software was used to predict the energy savings of the new window design. The simulation results showed an increase in the heat gain through the new window of up to 38% over the conventional double-glazing low-e window during the heating period for heavy thermal mass buildings, and 14% for light weight thermal mass buildings. At the same time, the window maintained its low heat gain properties in the cooling season. When used in moderate climates, the new adaptive window will significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings during both the heating and the cooling seasons.",

          "abstract": "Abstract Bridge freezing before roads is a major concern in cold climates as it is a major cause for road accidents. Several active systems were made to prevent bridge surface freezing. These systems include several automated and complex systems such as automatic anti-freeze spray, using phase change materials in the concrete bridge’s deck, and imbedding heating system in bridge’s decks. These systems are usually expensive to run and operate and some of these systems have negative impact on the environment. This research investigates using radiant heaters for maintaining the concrete temperature within the required limits. Several passive and active methods are used to maintain concrete temperature above the that of the adjacent road. Radiant heaters provide direct, instantaneous, and uniform heating to the bridge surface. The Infrared radiant heating method was tested using an environmental control chamber. Two concrete samples were placed in the climate chamber that simulates cold weather. Thermocouples were used to record the surface temperature, the middle of the concrete samples’ temperature and the bottom of the samples’ temperature. Infrared camera was also used to measure and verify the concrete surface temperatures. The data analysis showed that concrete surface temperature dropped quickly and become significantly lower than the ambient temperature in the absence of solar radiation. However, introducing radiant heating brings the concrete surface temperature and the core temperature of the concrete samples to the required temperature in a short period of time. A comparison between this research results and other research that investigated the performance of other freezing prevention methods showed that using radiant heating to prevent bridge freezing is effective, economical, and can be applied to existing bridges.",

          "abstract": "This research presents a case study of a single-family home in Georgia, United States, that achieves near net-zero energy costs for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system with near-zero additional capital investment. Building information modeling (BIM), energy analysis, and practical common construction practices were integrated to trade-off between design and construction alternatives to achieve these results. An accelerated number of publications addressed net-zero energy buildings (NZEB). Much of this research addresses means and methods to make buildings produce as much energy as they consume (net-zero site or building energy) or make buildings produce energy and sell it to offset the buildings’ energy bills (net-zero cost). However, NZEBs still constitute a small fraction of the building industry, which is mainly due to higher initial costs, significant deviations from common construction practices, or altering common building operations and comfort levels. In this research, a practical approach for achieving NZEB was tested and used in constructing a single-family home. BIM software that generates annual energy consumption with every design alternative was used during the design and construction phases of this home. The BIM model was also used to generate building materials quantities to estimate the initial construction cost. In this case study, the initial construction cost of the selected design was less than that of comparable homes in the same area. The post-occupancy evaluation showed that the annual energy consumption related to heating and cooling was 72% less than that of comparable homes in the same area. Energy consumption related to hot water consumption was 21% less, and energy consumption for lighting was reduced by 22%. In conclusion, general design guidelines and lessons learned are established to help the residential building industry adopt energy-efficient design and construction approaches to reduce energy consumption i",

This “preferential icing” increases the possibility of cars having accidents over bridges. The objective of this research is to decrease preferential icing over bridges. This research investigates optimizing the bridge’s surface thermal properties in order to keep the bridge deck surface temperature from reaching the freezing point before the adjacent roads. Field data and thermal transfer simulations were used to investigate the effect of surface reflectancy, moisture transfer and wind on the freezing of bridges and roads. First, the Energy-Plus computer simulation model was used to simulate a typical bridge and road structure in a relatively cold climate. These computer simulation models were validated with field readings. Then, different surface properties of the concrete bridge deck were tested and integrated to match the freezing cycle of the bridge deck with the adjacent road surface. This research has shown that reducing reflectancy and emissivity of the bridge deck surface would reduce the freezing cycle of the bridge deck. This research also concluded that optimizing the surface properties and the exposure of bridges’ decks should lower the traffic accidents due to preferential icing (icing of bridge surface before adjacent roads).",

Temperature-programmed desorption at low vanadia loadings revealed reactivity at much lower temperature (370 K) as compared to pure ceria and vanadia on inert supports such as silica. Density functional theory is applied and the energies of hydrogenation and oxygen vacancy formation also predict an enhanced reactivity of the vanadia/ceria system. At the origin of this support effect is the ability of ceria to stabilize reduced states by accommodating electrons in localized f-states.",

The Archean ocean may have been strongly phosphorus-limited due to the selective binding of phosphate to iron oxyhydroxide. Here we report a new route to solubilizing phosphorus in the ancient oceans: reduction of phosphate to phosphite by iron(II) at low (<200 °C) diagenetic temperatures. Reduction of phosphate to phosphite was likely widespread in the Archean, as the reaction occurs rapidly and is demonstrated from thermochemical modeling, experimental analogs, and detection of phosphite in early Archean rocks. We further demonstrate that the higher solubility of phosphite compared to phosphate results in the liberation of phosphorus from ferruginous sediments. This phosphite is relatively stable after its formation, allowing its accumulation in the early oceans. As such, phosphorus, not as …",

          "abstract": "We present a study of the reactions of the meteoritic mineral schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P, focusing primarily on surface chemistry and prebiotic phosphorylation. In this work, a synthetic analogue of the mineral was synthesized by mixing stoichiometric proportions of elemental iron, nickel and phosphorus and heating in a tube furnace at 820 °C for approximately 235 hours under argon or under vacuum, a modification of the method of Skála and Drábek (2002). Once synthesized, the schreibersite was characterized to confirm the identity of the product as well as to elucidate the oxidation processes affecting the surface. In addition to characterization of the solid product, this schreibersite was reacted with water or with organic solutes in a choline chloride–urea deep eutectic mixture, to constrain potential prebiotic products. Major inorganic solutes produced by reaction of water include orthophosphate, phosphite …",

Struvite (MgNH4PO4·6H2O) is an ammonium-bearing phosphate mineral considered to be relevant to the origin of organophosphates on the early Earth, and it is possible that this mineral may have formed on the early Earth and in meteorites in favorable environments. However, in contrast to other phosphate minerals such as those within the apatite mineral group, there is little evidence of struvite on the early Earth and no detection of it in meteorites, where such high-N (nitrogen) and low-H2O conditions may be more commonplace. Here, we demonstrate that struvite quickly loses ammonia and transforms into a new suite of minerals; hence, this mineral is ephemeral.

A protocol for creating synthetic metal-phosphide samples with a surface reflectivity suitable for reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) was developed and is outlined in this paper. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed an average defect size less than 1 mu m and evidence of subsurface phosphorus segregation. At surface temperatures between 120 and 140 K, RAIRS spectra indicate that water and formic acid interact molecularly with surface atoms, while methanol appears to dissociate into methoxy and protons upon adsorption. The observed infrared spectra provide insight into the adsorption geometries of these prebiotic molecules on synthetic schreibersite. This data suggests the importance of the schreibersite mineral surface in aqueous-phase schreibersite-mediated phosphorylation experiments that have been performed by others and strengthens the argument that schreibersite-induced chemistry could, Occur in astrochemical environments.",

          "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges within origins of life research is known as the “phosphorus problem.” The most abundant sources of phosphorus on the early Earth were phosphate minerals such as hydroxyapatite (HA) or Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 . Although HA is insoluble and does not react readily in most aqueous solutions, HA has been shown to phosphorylate nucleobases such as adenosine and uracil in solutions containing urea, ammonium formate and water. However, the mechanism for the dissolution of phosphorus from the surface of HA is unknown within these prebiotic solutions is unknown. Because HA is an insulator, it is difficult to study the mineral surface in situ using traditional surface-sensitive methods. Therefore, we are developing methods to grow thin hydroxyapatite films on a copper substrate. Polarization modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) is a technique that allows the structure of gas-solid and liquid-solid interfaces to be probed in situ . In order to utilize this analysis method, HA thin films must meet several criteria. The films must be deposited onto a substrate that has high reflectivity in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The choice of metal and the number of defects on the underlying substrate influence the infrared reflectivity. The underlying substrate should also provide easy temperature control. The films must be thinner than the wavelength of the light being reflected (in this case less than 2.5 microns) and they must be relatively uniform in structure and thickness. Electrochemical deposition of the HA films has been chosen for several reasons. First, this method allows for growth on mirror- finished samples, which results in higher signal intensity for the infrared measurements. Electrochemical deposition produces films with a homogeneous composition and customizable thickness. Additionally, this technique is cost efficient compared to synthesis using vacuum deposition methods (e.g., plasma enh",

We find that when REM is constrained by poor financial condition, high levels of institutional ownership and low industry market share, managers are more likely to use classification shifting. Further, we find that when AEM is constrained by low accounting system flexibility and the provision of a cash flow forecast, managers are more likely to use classification shifting.

Given that timeliness is an area of interest to investors, managers, regulators, auditors and academics, an understanding of ARL determinants is extremely important. As financial markets become more globally oriented, an international understanding of ARL determinants becomes even more important. This paper summarizes the extant literature on ARL and its determinants with an emphasis on international literature. Our review categorizes prior research based on company‐specific and audit‐related factors, and explores the associations that have been identified with respect to ARL. Finally, we identify possible areas of interest not currently present in the literature and speculate on several opportunities for future research.",

Managers with higher ability possess greater human capital and are better able to maintain the systems and controls underlying the company's financial information. We therefore predict that managers with higher ability produce more timely financial disclosures. We find that, incremental to firm‐level attributes, higher managerial ability is associated with a shorter earnings announcement lag, a shorter audit report lag, and a lower probability of a late US Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

We also find that knowledge spillover benefits related to the provision of tax nonaudit services moderate this positive association. In supplemental tests, we provide evidence on additional auditor responses to tax risk.

We find that stock returns around the development of Schedule UTP are negative, consistent with investors' concern that Schedule UTP would impose costs on firms. However, we document a significant positive stock price reaction to the release of the final draft of Schedule UTP in which the IRS relaxed many of the controversial provisions of Schedule UTP. Additionally, we find this positive reaction is incrementally larger for more tax-aggressive firms.

Prior research suggests that the GC position may have a significant influence in setting the tone at the top by promoting corporate integrity, ethics, and serving as a governance and monitoring mechanism, but also recognizes that prominent GCs may face ethical dilemmas, causing them to disregard professional responsibilities to curry the favor of the CEO and other executives. Using audit fees to proxy for audit engagement risk, we find a negative association between GC ascension to top management and audit fees. We investigate the mechanisms behind this relation and find GC ascension is associated with a reduction in both default risk and financial misstatement risk, which supports auditors’ perceived reduction in client business risk and audit risk, respectively.",

          "abstract": "We examine the relationship between residual audit fees and the ability to predict future earnings. Recent research suggests that residual audit fees contain information about accounting quality. However, residual audit fees could either represent high accounting quality or a risk premium for low accounting quality. We extend this literature by providing evidence that residual audit fees are indicative of a lower quality information environment which has a negative impact on investors’ ability to anticipate future earnings. Specifically, we first show that residual audit fees are negatively associated with the ability of current earnings to predict future earnings. Furthermore, residual audit fees are negatively associated with analyst forecast accuracy and positively associated with the dispersion in analyst forecasts. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that residual audit fees are indicative of poor earnings quality …",

We examine the association between a firm's access to IT‐capable labor and financial reporting quality (FRQ). We proxy for access to IT‐capable labor using workforce measures in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) where the firm operates, including (1) the number of IT‐related college degrees relative to the total active workforce, (2) the level of education of IT graduates, (3) the income level of IT graduates, and (4) a composite measure. We find that firms in MSAs with a higher IT‐competent labor force are associated with fewer financial reporting misstatements and internal control issues.

Evaluating capital investment decisions with contemporary investment efficiency and long-term measures of investment effectiveness, we document a positive relation between high-quality IT and capital investment decision quality. In particular, we find high-quality IT is associated with more optimal levels of investment as well as fewer future fixed asset write-downs. We also disaggregate investment efficiency and find the relation with IT quality holds for investment decisions related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, but not research and development expenditures. Overall, our results suggest managers equipped with better internal information from higher-quality IT are able to make superior capital investment decisions.

Using performance attribution analysis, the authors construct a long-short portfolio that buys (sells) stocks of firms with (without) a CMO in the TMT and find this investment strategy would have earned risk-adjusted excess returns of approximately 3%. Additional analyses suggest the value of having a CMO in the TMT manifests primarily among firms with high operating margin, low asset turnover, high profitability, high R&D intensity and high advertising expenses. The authors conclude that having a CMO in the TMT has a positive impact on shareholder wealth.",

We investigate whether tax avoidance, management compensation, and debt agreements affect the expense classification election and whether this discretion has implications for financial statement users. We find firms that engage in tax avoidance activities, measured by effective tax rates (ETRs) and involvement in tax disputes, are more likely to include interest and penalties in tax expense. We also find that interest and penalties are more likely to be classified as tax expense when CEO compensation is more sensitive to pre-tax income. Finally, we find that UTB interest and penalty expense classification is associated with analysts' ETR forecast accuracy, which suggests there is a potential unintended …",
