Our lab uses cutting-edge statistical and mathematical tools to explore the relationships\n                     between living things and our changing world. We are primarily focused on animals,\n                     especially vertebrates like the squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and human (Homo sapiens) at right. Our research spans the real and virtual worlds: projects in the QuantEco\n                     lab involve everything from field sampling and bench science to data analysis and\n                     simulation modeling. Use the links at left to explore the lab's research. You can\n                     also find information about the courses I teach.\nIf you  are a KSU undergraduate interested in gaining field and lab research experience\n                     with animals, reach out byemailso we can discuss details. We are currently gearing up for small mammal trapping fieldwork\n                     throughout the rest of 2025 and 2026. There are many levels of involvement available,\n                     from volunteer to research for credit (BIOL3110Lor4400).\nYou can follow the lab onBluesky(@greenquanteco.bsky.social) for updates and events.\nUseful links:\nDepartment of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB)\nMaster of Science in Integrative Biology (MSIB) program\nCollege of Science and Mathematics",

    "bio": "(Source: ASM) Microbiologists work in almost every industry - from food, agriculture and pollution\n                     control to biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and health. They also work in government\n                     agencies and labs, such as the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection\n                     Agency, water treatment facilities, and hospitals. They also work in education as\n                     teachers and researchers. Because there are so many different species of microbes\n                     out there and they do such very different things, no one microbiologist can study\n                     everything! That's why people who become microbiologists usually focus on a particular\n                     microbe or research area. Here are a few examples: Some microbiologists focus on bacteria\n                     and how they help or hurt us. These scientists are called bacteriologists. Some specialize\n                     in viruses and how they infect cells. These scientists are called virologists. Some\n                     study fungi in particular and are called mycologists. Some microbiologists track down\n                     outbreaks of disease to learn what caused them and if we're facing a deadly new microbe.\n                     They are called epidemiologists. Some study how the body defends itself against microbial\n                     invaders. They are called immunologists. This is only a partial listing of the many\n                     different things microbiologists do. If you really want to get a good sense of what\n                     microbiologists do, you should talk to some of them. You might start with the microbiology\n                     researchers here at KSU - Drs. Ramya Rajagopalan, Jean Lu, Micheal Beach, Chris Cornelison,\n                     Premila Achar, Andrew Haddow, Yoshi Masafumi or myself.\nCourses\n2260/2260L Fundamental Microbiology/Fundamental Microbiology Lab4460K Medical Microbiology with Lab3301K Intro to Biotechnology3340/3340L General Microbiology/ Microbiology Lab4635 Advanced Topics in Microbiology: Deadly Microbes7446 Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis (Graduate course)\nResearch Interest\nBacterial pathogenesis\nThe opportunistic human pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosahas one of the largest and most metabolically diverse genomes among bacteria.  The\n                     Griffin lab uses molecular biology approaches from PCR to transcriptomics to investigate\n                     differential regulation by an under-reported epigenetic regulator of a large group\n                     of metabolic pathways and virulence factors.\nPathogen-Specific Phages\nAs bacterial pathogens, especially the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter\n                        baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,andEnterobacterspp.), continually develop resistance to clinical applications of standard antibiotics,\n                     rapid identification of nonchemical-antibiotic therapies are attractive for future\n                     treatment of these organisms. Bacteriophages, viruses that target bacteria, have potential\n                     uses in alternative antibiotic therapies because of their abundance in nature and\n                     their high specificity of infection. Identifying common sources of phages within the\n                     environment, especially those that can infect the ESKAPE pathogens, could reveal untapped\n                     reservoirs of phages that are easily isolated and accessible for uses in clinical\n                     settings.\nCurrent Research Students\nUndergraduates\nJosefa Wulf, Lexie Williams, Francisco Armstrong\nMSIB graduate student\nAlexis Williams\nFuture Directed Study OpportunitiesGriffin lab will be looking for new students for Fall 2025.",

    "bio": "Dr. Lawler's scholarship focuses on equity issues in mathematicseducation; in particular, the ways in which power and knowledge intertwine to govern\n                        the learner's mathematical identity. His core research examines the personal epistemologies\n                        of adolescent mathematicians: Do high school maths students see themselves as mathematical\n                        authors? This interest leads him to seek to understand the ways that students come\n                        to know the school, classroom, and teacher contexts, and how these knowings interact\n                        with their mathematical identities.\nDuring his 30+ year career as a mathematics educator, he has supported teachers, schools,\n                     and districts to de-track mathematics programs and transform teaching practices. He\n                     is a contributing author to the internationally acclaimed high school mathematics\n                     curriculum Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP).\nHis current research projects (district changeandcommunity organizing) focus upon how schools and districts transform their mathematics instruction to\n                     foreground student ways of thinking (inventions) against the backdrop of high-stakes\n                     education.\n\"One [can] teach without reinforcing existing systems of domination.\"(bell hooks, 1994)",

    "bio": "I am fascinated by phenotypic variation and how behaviors and the environment can\n                     shape our brain and immune systems. Currently I am studying nature's super-healers\n                     to understand how we can teach the human body to regenerate and recover instead of\n                     scar and atrophy. I look at healing as a whole system: not just cells and genes, but\n                     how they connect and interact with the brain, behavior, and environment.\nI started research as an undergrad, curious how babies develop handedness and using\n                     rats as a model to understand how birth affects the brain. That curiosity grew into\n                     a passion for combining animal behavior with biomedical research. I realized that\n                     behavior (think, biomechanics, movement, and brain plasticity) is often overlooked,\n                     but can be a powerful tool to understand recovery after injury.\nNow, I leadThe Varholick Lab at Kennesaw State University. Our team explores how behavior, the environment, cells, and genes work together\n                     to drive healing, regeneration, and recovery. We're always looking for curious minds\n                     and new ideas, so if you're interested in tissue regeneration and behavior, let's\n                     connect!",
