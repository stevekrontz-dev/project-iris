The Archean ocean may have been strongly phosphorus-limited due to the selective binding of phosphate to iron oxyhydroxide. Here we report a new route to solubilizing phosphorus in the ancient oceans: reduction of phosphate to phosphite by iron(II) at low (<200 °C) diagenetic temperatures. Reduction of phosphate to phosphite was likely widespread in the Archean, as the reaction occurs rapidly and is demonstrated from thermochemical modeling, experimental analogs, and detection of phosphite in early Archean rocks. We further demonstrate that the higher solubility of phosphite compared to phosphate results in the liberation of phosphorus from ferruginous sediments. This phosphite is relatively stable after its formation, allowing its accumulation in the early oceans. As such, phosphorus, not as …",

Experimental band positions and intensities are compared to those predicted by density functional theory (DFT). Rh+ coordinates only four nitrogen molecules, whereas it can accommodate five carbonyl ligands.

However, in contrast to other phosphate minerals such as those within the apatite mineral group, there is little evidence of struvite on the early Earth and no detection of it in meteorites, where such high-N (nitrogen) and low-H2O conditions may be more commonplace.

As financial markets become more globally oriented, an international understanding of ARL determinants becomes even more important. This paper summarizes the extant literature on ARL and its determinants with an emphasis on international literature. Our review categorizes prior research based on company‐specific and audit‐related factors, and explores the associations that have been identified with respect to ARL. Finally, we identify possible areas of interest not currently present in the literature and speculate on several opportunities for future research.",

Managers with higher ability possess greater human capital and are better able to maintain the systems and controls underlying the company's financial information. We therefore predict that managers with higher ability produce more timely financial disclosures. We find that, incremental to firm‐level attributes, higher managerial ability is associated with a shorter earnings announcement lag, a shorter audit report lag, and a lower probability of a late US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Collectively, our results suggest that managerial ability has a positive influence on the timeliness of financial reporting.",

Our paper reviews the existing literature on the PCAOB’s four primary functions – registration, standard-setting, inspections, and enforcement. In particular, we examine PCAOB registration trends and evaluate the effects of PCAOB registration requirements on the issuer audit market, as well as discuss the relative costs and benefits (e.g., auditor behavior changes, improvements in audit quality, auditor perceptions) of the 16 auditing standards the PCAOB passed in its first 10 years of operation.

We find that stock returns around the development of Schedule UTP are negative, consistent with investors' concern that Schedule UTP would impose costs on firms. However, we document a significant positive stock price reaction to the release of the final draft of Schedule UTP in which the IRS relaxed many of the controversial provisions of Schedule UTP. Additionally, we find this positive reaction is incrementally larger for more tax-aggressive firms.

Further research has shown that having a corporate general counsel (GC) in a firm's top management team (top five highest-paid executives) significantly affects a firm's accounting and disclosure practices.

Specifically, we use the ascension of the corporate GC to top management as the identifying event in which the role and influence of the corporate GC becomes more salient. We find strong evidence that GC ascension to top management is associated with an increase in tax aggressiveness, as evidenced by greater book-tax differences and a higher likelihood of engaging in tax shelter activities.\nData Availability: Data are obtained from public sources identified in the paper.",

Prior research suggests that the GC position may have a significant influence in setting the tone at the top by promoting corporate integrity, ethics, and serving as a governance and monitoring mechanism, but also recognizes that prominent GCs may face ethical dilemmas, causing them to disregard professional responsibilities to curry the favor of the CEO and other executives. Using audit fees to proxy for audit engagement risk, we find a negative association between GC ascension to top management and audit fees. We investigate the mechanisms behind this relation and find GC ascension is associated with a reduction in both default risk and financial misstatement risk, which supports auditors’ perceived reduction in client business risk and audit risk, respectively.",

We investigate whether tax avoidance, management compensation, and debt agreements affect the expense classification election and whether this discretion has implications for financial statement users. We find firms that engage in tax avoidance activities, measured by effective tax rates (ETRs) and involvement in tax disputes, are more likely to include interest and penalties in tax expense. We also find that interest and penalties are more likely to be classified as tax expense when CEO compensation is more sensitive to pre-tax income. Finally, we find that UTB interest and penalty expense classification is associated with analysts' ETR forecast accuracy, which suggests there is a potential unintended …",

The fungus is mainly associated with maize, rice, sorghum, wheat, sugarcane, banana, and asparagus and causes cob, stalk, ear, root, crown, top, and foot rot. F. verticillioides produces fumonisins as the major secondary metabolite along with trace levels of beauvericin, fusaric acid, fusarin C, gibberiliformin, and moniliformin. Being a potential carcinogen, fumonisins continue to receive major attention as they are common contaminants in cereals and its processed food products. The importance of elimination of F. verticillioides growth and its associated fumonisin from cereals cannot be overemphasized considering the significant health hazards associated with its consumption. Physical and chemical approaches have been shown to reduce fumonisin B1 concentrations among feeds and food products but have proved to be ineffective during the production process. Hence, biological control methods using microorganisms, plant extracts, antioxidants, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and other advanced technologies such as growing disease-resistant crops by applying genetic engineering, have become an effective alternative for managing F. verticillioides and its toxin. The different methods, challenges, and concerns regarding the biocontrol of F. verticillioides and production of fumonisin B1 have been addressed in the present review.",

In the United States, significant losses have been reported in peanut production due to contamination caused by the Aspergillus species. This study evaluated the antifungal effect and anti-aflatoxin activity of selected plant-based essential oils (EOs) against Aspergillus flavus in contaminated peanuts, Tifguard, runner type variety. All fifteen essential oils, tested by the poisoned food technique, inhibited the growth of A. flavus at concentrations ranging between 125 and 4000 ppm. The most effective oils with total clearance of the A. flavus on agar were clove (500 ppm), thyme (1000 ppm), lemongrass, and cinnamon (2000 ppm) EOs. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of clove EO revealed eugenol (83.25%) as a major bioactive constituent. An electron microscopy study revealed that clove EO at 500 ppm caused noticeable morphological and ultrastructural alterations of the somatic and reproductive structures. Using both the ammonia vapor (AV) and coconut milk agar (CMA) methods, we not only detected the presence of an aflatoxigenic form of A. flavus in our contaminated peanuts, but we also observed that aflatoxin production was inhibited by clove EO at concentrations between 500 and 2000 ppm. In addition, we established a correlation between the concentration of clove EO and AFB1 production by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We demonstrate in our study that clove oil could be a promising natural fungicide for an effective bio-control, non-toxic bio-preservative, and an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic additives against A. flavus in Georgia peanuts.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activities of seventeen essential oils on the growth of the aflatoxigenic form of A. parasiticus in contaminated peanuts from commercial outlets in Georgia. The agar dilution method was used to test the antifungal activity of essential oils against this form of A. parasiticus at various concentrations: 500; 1,000; 1,500; 2,000; 2,500 ppm. Among the seventeen essential oils tested, the antifungal effect of cinnamon, lemongrass, clove and thyme resulted in complete inhibition of mycelial growth. Cinnamon oil inhibited mycelial growth at ≥ 1,000 ppm, lemongrass and clove oils at ≥ 1,500 ppm and thyme at 2,500 ppm. However, cedar wood, citronella, cumin and peppermint oils showed partial inhibition of mycelial growth. Eucalyptus oil, on the other hand, had less antifungal properties against growth of A. parasiticus, irrespective of its concentration. Our results indicate that the aflatoxigenic form of A. parasiticus is sensitive to selected essential oils, especially cinnamon. These findings clearly indicate that essential oils may find a practical application in controlling the growth of A. parasiticus in stored peanuts.",

In the glasshouse study, plants were subjected to 2%, 10%, 20%, 40% and 80% sea water, with tidal simulation, for 10 months. Increase in salinity from 2% to 20% sea water increased biomass accumulation, CO2 exchange, quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII), electron transport rate (ETR) through PSII, and intrinsic photochemical efficiency of PSII, while further increases in salinity to 80% resulted in significant decreases in these parameters. Concentrations of proline increased significantly with increase in salinity up to 80% sea water. In the field study, soil physicochemical conditions between streamside and inland sites were compared, and the constraints imposed by any differences on plant ecophysiological responses determined. At the inland site, soil water potential (ψ), electrical conductivity of the soil, total cations, and the concentrations of Na+, Ca2 +, Mg2 + and P, were significantly higher than those of the streamside site, while CO2 exchange, quantum yield of PSII, ETR through PSII, and intrinsic photochemical efficiency of PSII were significantly lower. The results suggest that S. maritima grows optimally at a salinity of about 20% sea water, and that higher salinity decreases growth and photosynthetic performance.",

Developing technology and multidisciplinary approaches are turning to genomic analyses in addition to traditional culture methods in diagnostics of fungal plant pathogens. The metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) method is preferred for genotyping identification of organisms, identification at the species level, illumination of metabolic pathways, and determination of microbiota. Moreover, the data obtained so far show that this new approach is promising as an emerging new trend in fungal disease detection. Another approach covered by mNGS technologies, known as metabarcoding, enables use of specific markers specific to a genetic region and allows for genotypic identification by facilitating the sequencing of certain regions. Although the core concept of mNGS remains constant across applications, the specific sequencing methods and bioinformatics tools used to analyze the data differ. In this review, we focus on how mNGS technology, including metabarcoding, is applied for detecting fungal pathogens and its promising developments for the future.",

Detached axillary shoots were transferred to MS basal salts plus B5 vitamins supplemented with various concentrations of α-naphthalene-acetic acid or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg dm−3 and 100 % rooting and optimal subsequent acclimatization was achieved on 1.0 mg dm−3 IBA. After 4 weeks of culture, the rooted shoots (>5 cm) were planted in pots containing peat, vermiculite and bark (2:1:1), covered with plastic domes and maintained at 25 °C for 2 weeks before being transferred to a glasshouse. Plant survival was about 40 %.",

Two genetic groups were differentiated by using three RAPD primers and correlated to the cultural morphology of the isolates. Of all the isolates tested, 79.4% were clustered into RAPD group I (RG I), which did not sporulate when cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C for 10 days. The rest of the isolates designated as RG II sporulated on PDA medium and showed a higher genetic variation. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the universal primers, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and ITS 4. Restriction digestion of PCR products displayed three types (RF A, RF B and RF C) of profiles. RF A was in accordance with RG I. RF B was consistent with RG II except for one isolate, U5. However, U5 displayed a unique profile and had no restriction sites for Hpa II and Hae III. The results indicate that two distinct genetic groups exist among S. maydis isolates from maize in S. Africa. The ITS1 and ITS2 regions of rDNA were sequenced and primers were designed. The designed primer pair P1/P2 permitted a sensitive and specific detection of S. maydis .",

The three cereals were subjected to four treatments as control (T1), Fusarium alone (T2), combination of Fusarium and A. salinestris treatment (T3), and only A. salinestris (T4). All the treatments were evaluated for total mass of seedlings, root and shoot length, seed germination, and vigor index (VI), and extent of rhizoplane colonization by A. salinestris was investigated. Further, greenhouse studies were conducted to learn the efficacy of A. salinestris in vivo conditions. Antifungal efficacy was tested by the dual-culture method which resulted in significant reduction in Fusarium growth. Infection by Fusarium was reduced up to 50% in treated cereals such as maize, sorghum, and wheat, and there was also significant increase in seedling mass in the three hosts. Maize showed the highest VI (1859.715), followed by sorghum (1470.84), and wheat (2804.123) with A. salinestris treatment. In addition, seed germination was enhanced to 76% in maize, 69% in sorghum, and 68% in wheat, respectively. Efficacy of rhizoplane colonization showed successful isolation of A. salinestris with high CFU rate, and furthermore, significant colonization inhibition by Fusarium spp. was observed. In the greenhouse conditions, on the 45th day of the experimental set-up, the highest shoot length/root length recorded in maize was 155.70/70.0 cm, in sorghum 165.90/48.0 cm, and in wheat 77.85/56.0 cm, and the maximum root mass recorded was 17.53 g in maize, 4.52 g in sorghum, and 1.90 g in wheat. Our present study showed that seed treatment by A. salinestris, may be used as an alternate biocontrol method against Fusarium infection in maize, sorghum, and wheat.",

The isolates displayed adaptability to a broad range of environmental conditions, including temperatures of 10–45 °C, pH 2–6, and salt up to 7%. The strains tolerated simulated gastrointestinal conditions of acid (pH-2), phenol (0.6%), and bile (0.3%) suggesting potential probiotic attributes. Lpb. argentoratensis MYSVCF5 inhibited F. oxysporum , two ESKAPE group bacteria ( P. aeruginosa , S. aureus ) plus S. paratyphi and E. coli . The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of Lpb. argentoratensis MYSVCF5 reduced the growth of fungal biomass by 94% and completely inhibited conidial germination, retaining activity even after extended cold storage. LC–MS/MS analysis identified organic acids in the CFS, with citric acid as the most abundant at 34.9 (± 0.3) µg/mL, followed by lactic (8.3 µg/mL) and malic acids (5.2 µg/mL).

For acute study, rats were treated with a single oral dose of 5.7 mg/kg of diplodiatoxin, whereas for sub-acute study, the rats received 0.27 mg/kg/day for 21 days. Acute and sub-acute diplodiatoxin treatment caused loss in body weight and feed intake along with symptoms including irritation, dullness, tremors and convulsions. Diplodiatoxin caused a significant increase in serum ASAT and ALAT and a decrease in activity in the liver in both acute and sub-acute studies. This compound also significantly inhibited RBC AChE. Sexual dimorphism was observed when male rats were compared with female rats (p < 0.05). The enzyme alterations observed in the affected enzymes recovered to the normal levels by day 7 post treatment (withdrawal study) in both acute and sub-acute treated rats. A negative correlation was observed with regard to these enzymes when serum was compared with liver. These enzyme profiles show increases in serum with parallel decrease in liver, indicating necrosis of liver. These results suggest that diplodiatoxin has potential to affect hepatic end-points.",

          "abstract": "In October and November of 1996, typical downy mildew symptoms appeared on rose plants cultivated in many areas in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. White mycelial mats were observed on the lower surface of young and mature leaves and on stems at the base of the plants and shoot apices. Leaves and stems developed purplish to black spots. Flowers and buds had downy mildew-like growth on peduncles, calyces, and petals. Plants were poorly developed and generally chlorotic, and several were stunted. The most severe symptoms included premature leaf drop followed by plant death. The fungus from leaf and stem lesions was identified microscopically as Peronospora sparsa based on the following characteristics: conidia, sub-elliptical ranging from 20 to 23 μm long and 14.0 to 18.0 μm wide; conidiophores 150 to 350 μm long and 6 to 10 μm wide. Conidiophores protruded through the stomata as bunches of slender structures bearing conidia at the tips. The optimum temperature for sporulation and germination was 18°C. Artificially inoculated healthy mature leaves and stems developed purplish to dark brown lesions similar to those described from the field samples. The fungus was confirmed on the artificially inoculated tissues to complete Koch's postulates. The disease has been reported in all rose growing regions in KwaZulu Natal and causes up to 100% losses in some areas since its first appearance towards the beginning of winter 1996. The president of the Natal Rose Society, KwaZulu Natal, predicts that in the year 2000 rose plants may be eliminated if immediate control measures for Peronospora sparsa are not implemented. Rose is grown for local needs and has high export value in South Africa. This is the first report of the downy mildew of rose caused by Peronospora sparsa in South Africa.",

The presence of diplodiatoxin in these isolates was detected by thin layer chromatography and further confirmed by atomic pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Samples containing diplodiatoxin showed a strong positive ion at m/z=307. MC34, MC35, MC43 and MC50 isolates of Potchefstroom region produced high amount of diplodiatoxin, whereas some of the isolates from Potchefstroom (D72, D74, D78, D79 and D80) and Cedara (CH3 and U3H) regions did not contain diplodiatoxin. Experiments were conducted to optimize in vitro production of diplodiatoxin using the isolate MC 43. A varied range of pH (3.0 to 5.0) and various culture media viz., PDB, CME, CLM and MSM were tested. Growth of mycelium and production of diplodiatoxin was maximum in PDB media at pH 4.5 and it was observed that diplodiatoxin was produced in detectable quantity in the cultures older than 6 weeks in this media. Further, diplodiatoxin was isolated and purified from 8-weeks-old cultures of MC43 isolate and confirmed by nuclear mass resolution. The standard and the compound purified showed similar NMR spectrum. Sixty-gram (fresh weight) mycelium yielded 19.52 mg of diplodiatoxin. Effect of diplodiatoxin on the growth of various bacterial strains in agar-gelled LB media was studied. They showed different range of tolerance to diplodiatoxin. The increasing order of tolerance to diplodiatoxin was Stenocarpella maydis < B. cereus < B. subtulus < P. fluorescense < E. coli. Further, the effect of different concentrations (4.88-49.70 microg/mL) of diplodiatoxin on the growth of S. aureus in LB liquid media was studied. Presence of diplodiatoxin in the media reduced cell growth as compared to the control thus, confirming anti-bacterial activity of diplodiatoxin.",

The metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) method is preferred for genotyping identification of organisms, identification at the species level, illumination of metabolic pathways, and determination of microbiota. Moreover, the data obtained so far show that this new approach shows promise as an emerging new trend in fungal disease detection. Another approach covered by mNGS technologies, known as metabarcoding, enables use of specific markers specific to a genetic region and allows for genotypic identification by facilitating the sequencing of certain regions. Although the core concept of mNGS remains constant across applications, the specific sequencing methods and bioinformatics tools used to analyze the data do differ. In this review, we focus on how mNGS technology, including metabarcoding, is applied in fungal pathogenesis and its promising developments for the future.",

This comprehensive text--ideal for today's behavioral finance elective--links finance theory and practice to human behavior. The book begins by building upon the established, conventional principles of finance before moving into psychological principles of behavioral finance, including heuristics and biases, overconfidence, emotion and social forces. Readers learn how human behavior influences the decisions of individual investors and professional finance practitioners, managers, and markets. The book clearly explains what behavioral finance indicates about observed market outcomes as well as how psychological biases potentially impact the behavior of managers. Readers see, first-hand, the implications of behavioral finance on retirement, pensions, education, debiasing, and client management. This book spends a significant amount of time examining how behavioral finance can be used by practitioners today. Readers utilize theory and applications in every chapter with a wide variety of end-of-chapter exercises, discussion questions, simulations and experiments that reinforce the book's applied approach.",

We find a positive relation between overoptimism and uncertainty, but very little or no optimism when uncertainty is low. If the uncertainty surrounding a firm is high, analysts have fewer reputational concerns when they act on their inclinations to issue optimistic forecasts. Portfolio strategies based on these findings generate abnormal returns. The results suggest that greater prior uncertainty leads to higher analyst optimism, which in turn causes market overvaluation and profitable portfolio strategies.",

Arbitrage costs are low because these assets have low fundamental risk, low transactions costs, and high dividend yields. We find that Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), or spiders, do not trade at economically significant discounts, unlike closed-end mutual fund shares. Although individual investors invest much more heavily in SPDRs than in S&P500 stock, investor sentiment is not an important determinant of the discount. The SPDRs redemption feature facilitates arbitrage so that sophisticated traders can take advantage of and eliminate mispricing. However, we also report a larger, economically significant discount for MidCap SPDRs. MidCap SPDRs are designed to track the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 index, an index of moderate …",

The effect of a traded stock basket, Standard and Poor’s Depository Receipts (SPDRs), on the link between index and options markets is also examined. We find that pricing efficiency within option markets improves but there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that a stock basket enhances arbitrage across markets. When transactions costs and short sales constraints are included, very few violations of inter-market pricing relationships such as put–call parity are reported. However, violations of within market pricing relationships such as the box spread remain frequent. Extensive analysis suggests that the results are robust.",

While the U.S. funds are priced closely to their net asset values, the country funds are not and can exhibit large, positive autocorrelations in fund premium. The mispricing of country funds is related to momentum, illiquidity, and size effects. We also find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between fund premium and market liquidity, which suggests that more active trading does lead to lower mispricing but only after a certain level of liquidity is reached.",

In traditional finance, which has been the dominant paradigm for several decades, investors make rational choices leading to maximizing expected utility. The fundamental issues of traditional finance are classical decision theory, rationality, risk aversion, model portfolio theory (MPT), the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). However, evidence shows that many of the assumptions and findings associated with traditional finance are invalid. Thus, behavioral finance researchers turned to observed behaviors to develop models that describe how investors actually reach their decisions. Behavioral finance uses insights from the social sciences to better understand the investor behavior of individuals, groups, and markets.

          "abstract": "This paper provides new insight into the relationship between short sales and stock market returns using a sample of stocks sold short in Canada. Short interest is defined in relation to trading volume. The results strongly support the assertion that short sales and excess returns are contemporaneously negatively correlated in Canada. The paper further finds that excess returns are more negative for small firms because the supply of shortable shares is constrained for these firms. Excess returns are less negative for stocks with associated options and convertible bonds. Importantly, the evidence is consistent with the proposition that informed traders short sell Canadian interlisted stocks in Canada, rather than the US, to exploit lower execution costs. Together the results suggest that less restrictive regulation of short sales will improve the efficiency of markets.",

This paper reports the results of experimental asset markets in which participants trade two assets. In some markets, price bubbles form. In these markets, traders will pay even higher prices for the asset with lottery characteristics, i.e., a claim on a large, unlikely payoff. However, institutional design has a significant impact on deviations in prices from fundamental values, particularly for an asset with lottery characteristics. Price run-ups and crashes are moderated when traders finance purchases of the assets themselves and are allowed to short sell.",

The migration of Te inclusions was also observed for annealing in a temperature-gradient field. We recorded a loss of resistivity of the detector-grade CZT after annealing in a Cd vapor. The underlying mechanism of this loss was discussed, and solutions including two-step annealing (Cd annealing followed by Te annealing) and one-step annealing with Cd and Zn pressure control were proposed to maintain high resistivity.",

          "abstract": "Cadmium manganese telluride (CdMnTe) is one of the semiconductor materials with potential applications at room-temperature for nuclear and radiological detection. CdMnTe crystals grown by Bridgman technique are prone to tellurium inclusions and related defects that limit their performance as X-rays and gamma-rays detectors. The major reason for this is that they are grown in a tellurium-rich environment. These defects could trap charges that are generated by X-rays and gamma rays thereby degrading the charge transport properties of the detectors and reducing their carrier lifetime. This in turn leads to poor performance by the detector. One of the solutions to this problem is post-growth thermal annealing. In this paper we present experimental results of annealing a CdMnTe wafer at 720 oC and in cadmium vapor. The CdMnTe wafer and cadmium were sealed in a quartz ampoule at a vacuum of 10-5 mbar. We used a three-zone furnace that enabled us to adjust the three heating elements to get a flat region of 720 oC in the temperature profile where the wafer was annealed. Infrared transmission microscopy showed changes to the sizes and positions of the tellurium inclusions. There are reductions in the dimensions of the medium-size Te inclusions. Some Te inclusions were completely eliminated while others broke up to form much smaller inclusions. Current-voltage measurements showed that the resistivity of the CdMnTe wafer was reduced by 71%, from 2.44 x 105 Ω-cm to 7.17 x 104 Ω-cm after annealing in Cd vapor.",

While the results are preliminary and focus on the whole network of 23 students at the HBCU and 25 students at the PWI, they are promising and help us better understand the importance and role of networks in student belonging at the two institutions. Social network analysis is a methodological approach that examines the relationships an individual actor or actors have with other individuals, groups, or organizations in an environment. The relationships are referred to as links, edges, or ties. Actors are referred to as nodes, alters, or vertices and may be places, organizations, or people. A primary goal of social network analysis is to depict the structure of a group (Wasserman & Faust 1994) by examining important relationships reflected in the strength, direction, and complexity (or number) of ties embedded in a network. The strength of such an approach is that it enables an analysis of social phenomena beyond the abstract social structures (eg social, economic, political) traditionally studied by researchers in the social and behavioral sciences (Wellman 1999). Ego-centered (or personal) networks make the individual the focus of attention where ego describes people (alters) close to him or her (Boissevain 1974; Wellman & Berkowitz 1988). According to Wellman (1999), such investigations “enable researchers to study community ties, whoever with, wherever located, and however structured… and avoid the trap of looking for community only in spatially defined ways”(p. 19). Whole networks, which may include egocentered networks, describe …",

Students from both institutions discussed opportunities and obstacles to embrace a “Black Engineer” identity. HBCU students unlike their PWI counterparts, reported faculty mentoring designed to enhance professional belongingness.

The central objective of the project is to conduct a comparative study of the factors affecting the success and pathways to engineering careers of African American students at a Predominantly White Institution (PWI), the University of Toledo, and a Historically Black University (Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University). Through this research we hope to gain insight into the factors affecting the social and academic well-being of students at PWIs and HBCUs from a psychological and anthropological perspective. For students from underrepresented groups in STEM at both HBCUs and PWIs it is generally recognized that social capital in the form of familial, peer and mentor support is critical to persistence in their major field of study. However, the role that embedded networks within student groups in general, and minority engineering affinity groups in particular, play in engineering students’ identity formation and academic success is not well understood. It is also not clear how other factors including institutional support and the attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented minority students affect the ability of these students to integrate into the social and academic systems at their institutions and how these factors influence the formation and development of their identities as engineers.

Large-volume CZT crystals, with thicknesses up to 2 cm and large effective areas of roughly 5–10 cm2, are needed to fabricate efficient detectors that meet the working requirements of federal agencies, such as the DOE/NNSA (Department Energy National Nuclear Security Administration), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Defense (DOD). However, because of the imperfect methods for growing crystals, the resulting large-volume crystals most often are not perfect single ones, and contain structural defects such as voids, pipes, impurities from source materials, tellurium inclusions and precipitates, vacancies, and vacancy-impurity complexes generated during the process of their production.

This paper presents results of post growth annealing of CdZnTe detectors that shows both reduction in the sizes of Te inclusions and the migration of the inclusions towards the high-temperature side of the crystal. Two set of annealing experiments were made. The first is annealing under Cd vapor overpressure in vacuum at 600 °C for 45 minutes at a temperature gradient of 10 °C/cm.

The study focuses on investigating the criticality of the following three factors: 1. The attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented students and how these attitudes influence their classroom and advising interactions and expectations, and the impact this has on the students’ sense of belonging and academic success; 2. The existing institutional support mechanisms at both institutions and students’ perceptions of their efficacy and the role they perceive these mechanisms play in their academic success; and 3. The influence of student organizations- specifically underrepresented minority engineering affinity groups and the embedded networks therein on the social and academic integration of African American students at the two types of institutions.",

For this reason, energy efficiency in manufacturing facilities is increasingly important for reducing operating costs and improving profits. Using microgrids to generate local sustainable power should reduce energy consumption from the main utility grid along with energy costs and carbon emissions. Also, microgrids have the potential to serve as reliable energy generators in international locations where the utility grid is often unstable. For this research, a smart microgrid system was designed as part of an innovative load management option to improve energy utilization through active Demand-Side Management (DSM). An intelligent active DSM algorithm was developed to manage the intermittent nature of the microgrid and instantaneous demand of the site loads. The controlling algorithm required two input signals; one from the microgrid indicating the availability of renewable energy and another from the manufacturing process indicating energy use as a percent of peak production. Based on these inputs the algorithm had three modes of operation: normal (business as usual), curtailment (shutting off non-critical loads), and energy storage. The results show that active management of a manufacturing microgrid has the potential for saving energy and money by intelligent scheduling of process loads.",

          "abstract": "Cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor has applications in the detection of Xrays and gamma-rays at room temperature without having to use a cooling system. Chemical etching and chemo-mechanical polishing are processes used to smoothen CdZnTe wafer during detector device fabrication. These processes reduce surface damages left after polishing the wafers. In this paper, we compare the effects of etching and chemo-mechanical polishing on CdZnTe nuclear detectors, using a solution of hydrogen bromide in hydrogen peroxide and ethylene glycol mixture. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to monitor TeO2 on the wafer surfaces. Current-voltage and detector-response measurements were made to study the electrical properties and energy resolution. XPS results showed that the chemical etching process resulted in the formation of more TeO2 on the detector surfaces compared to chemo-mechanical polishing. The electrical resistivity of the detector is of the order of 1010 Ω-cm. The chemo-mechanical polishing process increased the leakage current more that chemical etching. For freshly treated surfaces, the etching process is more detrimental to the energy resolution more than chemo-mechanically polishing. The energy resolutions of the CdZnTe wafers are expected to improve as the surfaces stabilize and result in reduced surface currents.",

          "abstract": "Low enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of African American engineering students in the United States are a cause for concern [1]. Consequently, over the last decade there has been an upsurge of research identifying factors that have contributed to the problems encountered by African American students in higher education institutions in general, and in STEM fields in particular [2, 3]. The key factors identified as contributing to the attrition of minority African American students include perceptions of racism on campus, internalization of stereotypes, feelings of alienation and rejection, and inadequate support systems [4, 5]. In this context, considerations of institutional demographic characteristics, including the ethnic makeup of the student body is essential. Studies demonstrate that African American students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) experience lower levels of isolation and overt racism, and higher levels of retention compared to African American students in Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs)[6, 7]. While some studies suggest that African American students experience lower levels of stereotype threat in HBCUs [8, 9], other studies indicate that there is little significant difference between students attending PWIs and HBCUs in their perceptions of stereotype threat. Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a national sample of engineering students, Brown, Morning, and Watkins report that students enrolled in HBCUs had more favorable perceptions of their college experience and that the higher graduation rate of African American students in HBCUs compared to their PWI counterparts could be …",

Students more or less learn about some optimization methods during their different undergraduate courses, but a course that is focused only on some of the newer and more advanced optimization methods such as artificial neural network, data fitting and pattern recognition methods, analytical hierarchy process, agent based modeling, and game theory would be extremely beneficial to the undergraduate students that do not enter the graduate study, and will join the work force immediately after graduation.

          "abstract": "Abstract The central objective of this interdisciplinary, inter-institutional project is to conduct a comparative study of the factors affecting the success and pathways to engineering careers of African American students at a Predominantly White Institution (PWI) and a Historically Black University (HBCU). The study focuses on the following three factors: 1. The attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented students and how these attitudes influence their classroom and advising interactions and expectations, and the impact this has on the students’ sense of belonging and academic success; 2. The existing institutional support mechanisms at both institutions and students’ perceptions of their efficacy and the role they perceive these mechanisms play in their academic success; and 3. The influence of student organizations- specifically underrepresented Minority engineering affinity groups and the embedded networks therein on the social and academic integration of African American students at the two types of institutions. Here we report on the social network analysis conducted as part of this study. The data used was collected from focus group and individual interviews of African American engineering students at both institutions. We examined individual ego network maps of students and whole networks in the context of the narrative interviews to determine the role of the students’ networks in the survival strategy, integration, and success of members of underrepresented minority affinity groups in engineering versus African American engineering students who are not a part of these organizations. Through social network analysis we examine the importance of NSBE (at the PWI and the HBCU) and an engineering fraternity at the HBCU subcultures in fostering an environment that aids students’ integration into these respective university cultures. We explore whether there is a correlation between social integration as articulated through social network a",

          "abstract": "Thirty-one percent of annual energy consumption in the United States occurs within the industrial sector, where manufacturing processes account for the largest amount of energy consumption and carbon emissions. For this reason, energy efficiency in manufacturing facilities is increasingly important for reducing operating costs and improving profits. Using microgrids to generate local sustainable power should reduce energy consumption from the main utility grid along with energy costs and carbon emissions. Also, microgrids have the potential to serve as reliable energy generators in international locations where the utility grid is often unstable. For this research, a smart microgrid system was designed as part of an innovative load management option to improve energy utilization through active Demand-Side Management (DSM). An intelligent active DSM algorithm was developed to manage the intermittent nature of the microgrid and instantaneous demand of the site loads. The controlling algorithm required two input signals; one from the microgrid indicating the availability of renewable energy and another from the manufacturing process indicating energy use as a percent of peak production. Based on these inputs the algorithm had three modes of operation: normal (business as usual), curtailment (shutting off non-critical loads), and energy storage. The results show that active management of a manufacturing microgrid has the potential for saving energy and money by intelligent scheduling of process loads.",

At times, APPs and neonatal-perinatal medicine (NPM) fellows may experience tension in their professional relationship. They may perceive the other's performance and abilities differently. We hypothesized that satisfaction with the APP–NPM fellow interprofessional relationship would be associated with higher perception of APP competence by NPM fellows. Study Design We surveyed 274 medical providers: NPM fellows (24.8%), NPM program directors (24.5%), and APPs (50.7%). APPs were defined as neonatal nurse practitioners, pediatric nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or neonatal hospitalists. We obtained demographic data, information about sources of conflict in the APP–NPM fellow relationship, level of satisfaction with the relationship, and targeted interventions for improvement. NPM fellow perception of APP competence as well as APP self-assessed competence were elicited. Statistical analyses were performed with chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests. Results Overall, APPs and NPM fellows were generally satisfied with their relationship. All groups reported APP competence as equivalent to a third-year NPM fellow. NPM fellow perception of APP competence increased with year of fellow training. Higher perceived APP competence by NPM fellows correlated with higher relationship satisfaction scores. Difficulties with teamwork, communication and respect were associated with lower satisfaction within the APP–NPM fellow relationship. Conclusion The professional working dynamic between these two groups is viewed positively by all. Satisfaction with the APP–NPM fellow relationship correlated with higher perception of APP competence by NPM fellows. Targeted interventions that increase NPM fellow perception of APP competence and ameliorate the difficulties encountered in the APP–NPM fellow relationship may improve this interprofessi",

          "abstract": "There is currently a very limited set of engineering polymers that have been demonstrated as viable for use in 3-D printing. Additive manufacturing of custom components will require a much larger array of polymers, especially those with physical, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties that can be tailor-made. The development of ‘Ionic Polyimides’ offers a solution to this shortage by combining the well understood and widely accepted properties of conventional polyimides, with a new approach to polymer synthesis. Polyimides and polymeric ionic liquids (poly(ILs)) are at the forefront of advanced polymer materials, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. While it is clear that more types of polymer materials are needed for fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing, there is a need to explore these classes of materials. The synthesis process developed by the Bara Research Group at the University of Alabama allows full control over polymer structure, nanostructure, thermal, electrical, and physical properties making them a prime candidate for use in the additive manufacturing process. Furthermore, the new process allows us to tailor-make a high strength polymer that can be used to fabricate filament feedstock instead of pellets for 3D printing. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the relationship between molecular structure, physical properties, and performance of ionic polyimides. Further, we seek to determine their utility as materials suitable for additive manufacturing of components used in aerospace vehicles, with an emphasis on characterizing and simulating their thermal behaviors and properties. This proposal addresses the need for fundamental research on a customizable polymer filament feedstock for 3-D printing with tailor-made properties potentially making it superior to the commercial blends offered in industry today. The deliverables for this project are the creation of a database that will detail the re",

The regulation of midwifery services—of certified nurse‐tnidwives (CNMs)—relative to obstetricians (OBs) is analyzed within this framework. Demand‐side (quality assurance) effects are distinguished from supply‐side (Stigler‐Peltzman) effects in the model. Since both unambiguously predict a price increase, we focus on the regulatory impact on quantity. We find, within the empirical model, that while both effects are present, supply‐restricting effects dominate quality assurance in the U.S. market for CNM services. When mean regulations are compared to minimum regulations in the sample, CNM births increase from just under 6% of all births to a little over 11%. On net, regulation reduces the quantity of CNM births.",

In cases where an entire tract or parcel of land is condemned, the appraiser’s primary purpose is to estimate the market value of the complete taking at the time of the condemnation. When only a fraction of a tract or parcel of land is condemned, the appraiser must not only estimate the market value of the taking at the time of the condemnation, but must also estimate the consequential damages to the remaining part of the tract or parcel, less any benefits to the remaining part of the tract or parcel. As such, positive and negative externalities are given due consideration in determining a final estimate of the value of the taking.

Industry-wide averages can be a useful starting point in calculating a reasonable royalty as royalty rates in various industries exhibit distinctly different central tendencies. In this paper, we compare the results of recent Federal Appeals Court decisions involving royalty rate awards with royalty rate data from arm’s-length non-litigation sources to see if litigation results in higher royalty rates.\nThe venue for patent infringement cases typically resides in federal court because patents are governed by …",

Specifically, the article discusses scholarship related to the critique of neoclassic economic theory’s role in influencing the Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics and the trickle-down effects into state standards and textbooks. From the literature, the author uncovers two main critiques of neoclassicism: that neoclassic theory is unrealistic and impersonal. Neoclassic theory has enormous consequences for the civic mission of social studies. The author investigates the extent to which neoclassical theory makes for good citizenship and is desirable for a democratic society.",

Becoming teacher is a way for teachers and teacher educators to rethink professional identity for the fostering of justice and equity.",

The study revealed several trends and issues related to K-12 economics textbooks, including publishing trends, the extent to which economics curriculum is relevant and enactive, and the influence of neoclassical economic theory in serving as the “official knowledge” undergirding the curriculum. The review presents debates in the field related to these issues.

After presenting an overview of the field of social studies and concerns over disciplinary definitions and designations, we show how theory can be put into practice with descriptions of three activities we did with elementary and secondary-focused preservice teachers designed with an intra-disciplinary approach in mind. These activities include a walk through a local neighborhood, a trip to a nearby organic grocery store, and a field trip to the state art museum.

They present opportunities for inquiry into geographic, civic, and economic concerns in students’ communities. It is precisely the students’ familiarity with these stores that lends itself to critical inquiry and fosters civic agency. Such field trips not only align with social studies content in civics, geography, and economics, but they can also inspire students and teachers to ask thoughtful questions about their communities and to think about human behavior—including their own.",

Specifically, we are interested in how a fictional metal with extraordinary vibrant properties, known as beskar, reflects/mirrors aspects of identity articulation and formation for the show’s main protagonist, Din Djarin. Using a (mimetic) narrative approach, we constructed two composite narratives around two scenes depicting the aliveness of beskar in different ways.

Elements and principles of design vary from textbook to textbook, and this lack of consistency must be addressed when creating a single cohesive interior design vocabulary. This research study sought to gather fundamental information pertaining to the elements and principles of design, such as types of class formats being employed, foundational textbooks utilised, and within each curriculum where the elements and principles were being introduced in CIDA‐accredited interior design programmes. Furthermore, this study assessed the attitudes and perceptions of interior design educators concerning the elements and principles of interior design. The elements and principles of interior design are an integral part of design students' education and will contribute substantially to their skill set in the professional realm. For this reason, it is important that the design elements and principles are taught in a consistent manner, with emphasis placed on their meanings, substance and appropriate applications.",

Demographics indicate that while household numbers have gotten smaller over the decades, house sizes have become considerably larger. There has been little diversity offered in housing types, with builders and consumers favoring the detached single-family home as the icon of American success. But overwhelming recessionary pressures on American housing since 2007 have taken a toll. The housing market collapse has led to many foreclosures and subsequent vacant single-family homes, while simultaneously creating a scarcity in the rental market. Rising unemployment has seen Generation Y college graduates flocking back to the nest of their parental homes, baby boomer parents wonder when their nest will become less crowded, and the elderly are desperately trying to remain in their homes. The stock of affordable US housing is shrinking, and little new construction is on the horizon. These realities have led to a shortage of affordable housing, and motivated residents to choose complex housing arrangements, including shared housing, doubling up, and accessory dwelling units (ADUs). The ADU is examined for the financial, social, and personal benefits it can provide as an alternative to families living alone in single-family homes. For many, the partitioning of a home can provide solutions to housing children, parents, and also renters who might generate extra income to help with the mortgage. The additional benefits of ADUs for the rapidly growing elderly population are investigated, and seven flexible design models proposed as potential housing solutions.KEYWORDS: housingaccessory dwelling unit (ADU)baby boomerGeneration Yelderlynest",

Drawing for new materialisms, specifically Bennett’s (2004, 2009) notion of (metallurgic) thing-power and IJsseling’s (1997) conceptualization of mimesis, we entangle our (posthuman) perspectives with scenes from a popular science fiction show, The Mandalorian. Specifically, we are interested in how a fictional metal with extraordinary vibrant properties, known as beskar, reflects/mirrors aspects of identity articulation and formation for the show’s main protagonist, Din Djarin. Using a (mimetic) narrative approach, we constructed two composite narratives around two scenes depicting the aliveness of beskar in different ways. We also make an argument for the further interrogation into the way that metals are mined, manufactured, and manipulated and how these processes factor into the making and un-making of what it means to be human in a more-than-human world.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the population status of a species is vital for their conservation. Over the last two decades, multiple methods for surveying lion (Panthera leo) populations have been designed and tested. Each have strengths and weaknesses, with different applications, and varying levels of reliability, accuracy and precision. We conducted a PRISMA systematic review to identify and assess survey methods for estimating lion population abundance. We searched the Web of Science and Google Scholar for peer reviewed papers between January 1991 and December 2022. Sixty-five papers were included, with some using multiple methods or multiple study sites; when these were separated, 93 studies were identified. Seven broad population survey methods for lions were identified: call ups (34.8% of studies), spoor counts (32.5%), direct observations (15.7%), direct observations with capture recapture elements (12.4%), camera trap-based capture-recapture analysis (4.5%), genetic surveys (3%) and distance-based surveys (1.1%). Our literature review suggests that the most reliable methods for determining lion density or abundance are direct observations and camera trap-based capture recapture surveys. Genetic surveys combined with spatially-explicit capture recapture analysis also hold significant potential. Due to their lack of reliability and tendency to over-estimate populations, call ups and spoor counts are not recommended for determining population abundance. We further recommend that harmonized methods be developed that can produce comparable and reliable estimates, which can be used to inform conservation decisions across the species range.",

Findings indicate that CRP was not strongly emphasized or well aligned in most courses. Indeed, across most or all courses, we found the following: a lack of emphasis on democratic classrooms; a lack of alignment between CRP objectives, assignments, and rubrics; a lack of evidence that depth of CRP knowledge was required across courses; problems with course design; and a lack of emphasis on identity and cultural competence.

However, even with the current enthusiasm for the establishing the new practices, a working definition of pre-service co-teaching remains elusive. Thus, the study of the voices of educators who are involved in co-teaching is essential as universities make the transition from single-taught to co-taught clinical experiences.

The researcher questioned how teachers at various levels foster empowerment in historically disenfranchised students. The four participants, chosen by convenient sampling, were questioned about their perceptions of their empowerment, and narratives were collected in written and interview form from all participants. The data collected through the narrative inquiry were analyzed thematically. Resilience is a theme that emerged from the data analyzed in this study. The analysis of the data also revealed the theme of being\" older\" than their ages. The students described the importance of caring teachers fostering their empowerment as integral to their success and described plans to pay that forward to younger children in their area.",

In addition, a number of schools across the P-20 landscape are engaging in discussions around equity and racism and responding in ways that address racist systems and policies. We conclude this article with a discussion of what institutions of higher education should aspire to in order to humanize the educational contexts for a more equitable and anti-racist society.

The study was designed to examine how empowerment was realized in the lives of those students. The author examines the way the students discuss their experiences in school, at home, and in their community in order to uncover the extent of empowerment each one may or may not be experiencing in his life. In addition, the author looks at the ways their dialogues uncover emerging themes that show how school may or may not be fostering youth empowerment. Chapter one begins by describing the process the author went through in making decisions about designing the study and presenting it. Chapter two includes a brief review of the literature on youth empowerment and marginalized youth. Chapter three examines interpretive phenomenology and the importance of Vagle (2011) on this study. In particular Karin Dahlbergs work on bridling (2001) is of importance to this study, as that practice was an integral part of the author distancing herself from the data and the words of the students. Chapter four highlights four of the participants as they discuss empowerment and as each highlights issues of control, power, and inadequacy. Finally, chapter five includes an extension of the review of literature in order to explore literature relevant to the themes that emerged during the study, and then concludes with a discussion of the implications and significance of this study. Examinations of the dialogues of each of the students highlighted here reveal a disconnect between the students and the system of …",

This research was enacted at a research-intensive university in the United States in 2020 and 2021. We describe the need for the shift in stance to students as partners in our institution as well as what the findings indicate as imperatives for teachers in both K–12 settings and institutions of higher education. The findings indicate how teachers’ mental health and experiences of stress were affected by specific attributes of the pandemic and pandemic teaching (which aligns with the majority of COVID-19 research in education), as well as how some learned to cope with these demands. Findings also indicate the need for flexibility in all learning environments.",

These kids are all on different performance levels!” Dr. Adams replies,“Welcome to a typical classroom. 22 The candidates decide to continue their discussion in their regular class meeting.

Supervisory practices were situated in a collegial, reflective and developmental model of supervision. The participant sample included 41 teacher candidates, along with 41 of their collaborating teachers and 15 field supervisors who supervised four to six candidates throughout the yearlong experience. Our findings indicate that we, along with our collegial supervisors, used collaborative and non-directive approaches to structure the dialogue with our teacher candidates and the collaborating teachers as well as goal-setting techniques to promote self-directed and self-regulated learning in the candidate. Implications of the study include the following needs for colleges of education:(a) to prepare supervisors specifically to support their candidates in theorizing practice and justifying their instructional decisions with research;(b) to develop a shared language that defines and describes various forms and notions of assessment; and (c) to provide additional support and professional development for supervisors responsible for supervision of candidates in P-12 programs in this new era of national assessment and accountability for the outcomes of their candidates.",

The program includes linguistically, culturally, and socioeconomically marginalized children performing below grade level in reading. Pre-service teachers (PSTs) work with the children for 4 weeks, focusing on science-based literacy instruction. The initial findings of this case study were that lesson planning, teacher dispositions, and willingness to accept feedback are critical for PSTs. Additionally, a major concern in the findings is the increased evidence of mental health concerns for the children and PSTs. The findings indicate a need for focused training on social–emotional learning with special care relating to stressors caused by COVID-19. There must also be additional training for PSTs on explicit and detailed lesson plans, adjusting their dispositions, and science-based literacy instruction taught in literacy blocks.",

The purpose of this scoping review was to evaluate the psychometric properties of quality of life assessment instruments used with heart failure patients, to include patients who may be treated with a wearable left ventricular assist device. Eligible articles were retrieved from medical and allied health databases on studies evaluating the properties of instruments used to measure quality of life in heart failure patients. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments taxonomy was used to assess measurement properties of instruments used in 18 studies selected for review. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Plus-Heart Failure, received the highest score. Fourteen of the 18 reviewed studies scored above the acceptable score of 72, while 4 scored below 72. The risk of bias was minimized with 2 reviewers providing feedback on the study protocol and literature review. However, using more than 2 reviewers may have further reduced this risk. Findings inform nurse clinicians, researchers, educators, and policymakers about selecting instruments for assessing heart failure patients' quality of life, to include patients using a wearable device.",

The X-ray CT images provided exact locations of aggregate, sand mastic and air voids to develop 2D and 3D models. An experimental program was developed with a uniaxial compression test to measure the dynamic modulus of sand mastic and asphalt mixtures at different temperatures and loading frequencies. In the DEM simulation, the mastic dynamic modulus and aggregate elastic modulus were used as input parameters to predict the asphalt mixture dynamic modulus.

          "abstract": "Today, construction is essential to every economy since it employs many workers and significantly contributes to GDP. The construction industry’s efficiency has lagged behind other industries for decades due to low productivity, a lack of research, and poor adoption of advancements. Fortunately, the successful development of digital technologies such as Digital Twin (DT) has facilitated growth in many sectors, and DT has the potential to address challenges in building construction projects. While DT is a virtual replica that provides real-time data and analysis of a physical asset to optimize its performance, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a collaborative process for creating, managing, and exchanging information throughout a construction project. BIM is the most efficient way to create an accurate, high-value DT and support industry transformation. An integrated DT and BIM platform can improve building design, construction, and performance in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sectors. Based on a literature review, this research aims to clarify and differentiate DT from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, such as BIM. Related publications from articles about DT and BIM in the construction industry were selected, identified, and organized after careful research of the relevant scientific databases. The research has three primary objectives: (1) to examine the present applications of DT and BIM in the construction industry; (2) to emphasize the similarities and differences between the two; and (3) to develop solutions and design methods for BIM and DT integration in building construction.",

A series of tests, including empirical, viscosity, rutting, fatigue, cracking, storage stability, and chemical tests, were performed to determine the influence of soda lignin on asphalt binder. Test results revealed that the addition of lignin helps to reduce the temperature sensitivity of the asphalt by increasing its hardness and decreasing its ductility. At the same time, the incorporation of soda lignin powder also increased the viscosity of base asphalt with the increase in lignin content. Furthermore, rheological performance test results revealed that the …",

The curing kinetics and reaction mechanisms of the resin systems were studied using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR). Dielectric properties, thermal stability, and hot/wet resistance of the hybrids have been investigated. FT-IR results show that both temperature and POSS content may influence the curing reaction of CE. POSS-NH 2 mainly displays the catalytic effect at higher temperature (220°C). Dielectric results indicate that NC1 containing 1 wt% of POSS displays not only the lowest dielectric constant but also the lowest dielectric loss. The increase in POSS content leads to significant increase in glass transition temperature ( T g ) at lower POSS content (≤5 wt%). However, further increase in POSS content (&gt;5 wt%) does not lead to great increase in T g . Besides, all the POSS-NH 2 /CE hybrids show lower water absorption than that of CE.",

For each mixture, laboratory specimens were fabricated using a superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) with 25, 50, and 75 gyrations, respectively. The coefficient of permeability increased as the air void and porosity values increased. After the first moisture conditioning, the porosity and coefficient of permeability increased for most of the specimens. After the second moisture conditioning, it was observed that specimens had a reduced porosity and coefficient of permeability. There were significant differences for porosity and permeability before and after the first moisture conditioning. However, there were no significant differences for porosity and permeability before and after the second moisture conditioning. Regarding moisture conditioning, the 12.5-mm gradation tended to have a more stable structure than the 9.5-mm gradation. This tendency was indirectly observed from the rutting performance test.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using WEBs to modify bitumen and promote the performance of WEB-modified bitumen. In order to verify this assumption, a series of basic or rheological experiments were conducted on different dosages of WEB-modified bitumen. The test results and phenomenon showed that the WEBs could be used to modify the binder homogeneously by using a high-speed shearing machine. The basic experiments showed that the WEBs could decrease the penetration and ductility while increasing the softening point and the rotational viscosity. Additionally, the rheological experimental data indicated that the high temperature performance was improved while the low temperature performance stayed the same. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results demonstrated that modification of the WEB was a physical modification without chemical reaction and the main component of the modifier was polyethylene. The fluorescence microscope (FM) data revealed the micro-structures of different dosages of WEB-modified bitumen. In conclusion, WEB can be a feasible binder modifier.",

          "abstract": "In this study, an idealised asphalt mixture was modelled with the discrete element method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases. The air voids were randomly generated and counted within the models to reach a specific air void level (e.g. 6%). The 2D models were used to compute the strain and stress responses when the specimens were subjected to a compressive load. Then, the moduli of the specimens were computed from the stress-strain curves. The 3D idealised model was generated using a number of layered 2D models. The air void distribution patterns were also studied with 2D and 3D randomly generated models at specific air void levels. The results showed that the modulus deviation increases when the air void level increases. In addition, the modulus deviations of the 3D models were found to be much lower than those of the 2D models. When comparing the modulus predictions from the 2D models with those from the 3D models, the research proved that the 3D models yielded higher moduli than the 2D models. The average of the predicted modulus difference between 2D and 3D models was 26% at 10% air voids, and 7% at 4% air voids. When the air void increased from 0 to 10%, the modulus decreased by 30% in the 3D models, when compared with 48% in the 2D models. The 2D and 3D models predicted the same modulus for 0% of air voids. However, the 2D models under-predicted the mixture modulus, especially when the air void level was higher. In the 2D modelling of the asphalt mixtures, a large number of models were needed to achieve a reasonable prediction due to larger deviation, even at lower air void levels. At higher air void levels, the 3D models yielded a much higher prediction than 2D simulations. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.",

          "abstract": "The swelling behavior of clay minerals is widely known for its importance in soil and environmental sciences and its detrimental effects in engineering fields. Although more than 70 percent of all clays are of mixed-layer types, the vast majority of the previous experiments and simulations are focused on pure clays, which cause the swelling mechanism of the widespread mixed-layer clay (MLC) and its role in soils are little understood, especially the most common illite-montmorillonite (I-M) mixed-layer clay (MLC). This paper reports on a molecular dynamics (MD) study of the differences in swelling behavior between I-M MLCs containing K+ and Na+ and Na-montmorillonite (MMT). It captures the evolution of quantitative properties such as basal spacing d, interaction energy, and many hydrogen bonds in the clay interlayer, increasing hydration for the first time through the scripts. It is found that MLCs have smaller swellings than Na-MMT due to the asymmetric interlayer charges and mixed counterions in the I-M interlayer. However, in terms of the interaction energy for the in-depth reason of swelling, it is found that the clay-clay interaction energy and the clay-ion interaction energy drop, while the clay-water interaction energy increases with increasing hydration. In addition, the attractive interaction of clay-bound water seriously promotes swelling, and it is mainly composed of Coulomb interaction and Van der Waals interaction. The higher the K+ concentration, the more noticeable these phenomena are. Besides, it is also reported that the number and distribution mechanism of hydrogen bonds in MLCs are very different from that of pure clay. This work provides insight into the molecular mechanism for initial swelling and clay-bound water interaction in widespread MLCs. This will help to decipher its specific role in soils and minimize clay swelling.",

This study examines the morphology and positions of aggregates, sand mastic and air void phases of asphalt concrete. Three different samples with targeted air void levels of 4%, 7%, and 10% were analyzed using an X-ray microscope. The cylindrical asphalt specimens were cut into slabs and then polished, and finally white zinc-oxide powder was pressed into the voids. The zinc-oxide powder helped to discern air voids from aggregate and mastic. After sample preparation, elemental maps were constructed using characteristic Ka x-rays from the following elements: aluminum, silicon, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc, and strontium. The relative intensities of pixels in the elemental maps were used to categorize pixels in each image according to sand mastic, air voids, and aggregate using multi-spectral analysis techniques. Air void contents in the three images (A, B and C) are correlated to those computed from the asphalt concrete. It was found that the air void contents in the three images (A, B) are highly correlated to those computed from the asphalt concrete. The images were utilized to calculate aggregate gradations and compared with the real gradation. It is concluded that the micro structure characterization technique to capture the multi-phase nature of asphalt concrete using x-ray microfluorescence was moderately successful.",

          "abstract": "AbstractSettlement and non-uniform deformation of frozen soil subgrade introduce fatal cracks on semi-rigid base asphalt pavements. This research aims to use reinforced wire mesh to reduce serious cracks on semi-rigid asphalt pavements in frozen regions. Three impact factors, diameter and interval as well as two types of wire mesh have been analysed by loading tests. Results have shown that after setting the reinforced wire mesh: (a) failure load and displacement of the cement-stabilised crushed gravel samples have been improved; (b) diameter and interval of the wire mesh have interactive impacts on reinforced sample load capacity; (c) the reinforced wire mesh can limit cracks by redistributing stress in the specimen; and (d) the multiple linear regression model well reflects the variation of loading properties; the results make sense from the statistics view as well. Results also represent that the strengthened wire mesh can help spread out the applied load, and increase the overall loading capacity of cement-stabilised crushed gravel. The results provided a reference for semi-rigid base asphalt pavement cracks caused by non-uniform deformation on frozen soil subgrade as well as guidelines for construction and maintenance in frozen regions.Keywords: wire meshreinforcementcement-stabilised crushed gravelsemi-rigid base asphalt pavementload capacity AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the assistance and suggestions of the Editor-in-Chief, Professor Bahia, in preparing our paper for publication.

The inequality hypotheses investigated first overall correlations between warmth and competence, and whether these co-varied with Gini inequality coefficients. The inequality focus also compared how stereotypic traits and their respective socio-structural predictors vary across societies. Inequality emphasizes more than one dimension of intergroup perception to compensate. The stereotype content model (SCM) hypothesizes that many societal stereotypes are ambivalent. The stereotype content model suggests that depicting societal groups in ambivalent ways—such as fortunate in one sphere while unfortunate in another—may mask socio-economic disparities, facilitating, as a consequence, the rationalization and maintenance of the status quo. According to the SCM, competence and warmth …",

We frame good or bad barrels in the environmental context as a proxy of high or low probability of getting caught for dishonesty, respectively. We theorize: The magnitude and intensity of the relationship between love of money and dishonest prospect (dishonesty) may reveal how individuals frame dishonesty in the context of two levels of subjective norm—perceived corporate ethical values at the micro-level (CEV, Level 1) and Corruption Perceptions Index at the macro-level (CPI, Level 2), collected from multiple sources …",

Antiretroviral therapy has transformed the course of HIV/AIDS to a treatable, chronic illness worldwide. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a group intervention using motivational interviewing (MI) to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and use of risk reduction behaviors (RRB) among HIV-infected women in Nigeria. Recruited participants (n= 60) were randomly assigned to the motivational group or the health promotion program (HPP) control group. The 6 month follow-up results indicate that, compared to the control group, MI participants reported significantly higher levels of adherence to ART, higher knowledge of HIV, higher use of condoms/protection during sexual encounters and decision-making not to have sex when no protection was available. The MI participants also had fewer mean number of sexual partners. MI in group format shows promise in promoting adherence to ART and use of RRB in HIV-infected Nigerian women.",

Furthermore, South African managers endorse issues such as plan for knowledge acquisition, distribution, interpretation and organizational memory/performance. US companies invest in South Africa to gain access to its market and South African companies get into joint ventures with US companies to tap into the appropriate knowledge know‐how and financial resources.

Each individual's human emotional experience is culturally constructed or socio-culturally created under specific conditions, with the involvement of other human agents or variables to the causal processes. To advance research, we draw from theories and philosophical thoughts across cultures, from ancient times to modern era. In that context, emotion is the sine qua non of the totality of Yorùbá's beliefs about reality and it is the heart and soul of connectedness between people or places. The present study assessed human emotion factors among a business-oriented population and compared these views with distinctions proposed in the literature. Using a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for individual items across raters. Neither the Interest subscale or Surprise subscale nor the Guilt subscale demonstrated significant retest correlations in a comparison of the General and Specific Depression conditions; and also, of the Specific Depression and pre-examination conditions. More specifically, culturally mediated beliefs, values and traditions associated with socialization practices (political skills in case of workplace), have been hypothesized to play a role in the kinds of emotions display. Alternative interpretations of the data are examined and theoretical issues in need of further clarification are discussed.

          "abstract": "Abstract Recently, quality of teaching and learning has gained significant importance among Higher Education Institutes (HEI) stakeholders. Engineering education in many studies emphasizes the importance of using effective teaching strategies to enhance students' academic performance and students' satisfaction. These strategies help engineering educators in multiple ways, including creating a stimulating learning environment, actively involving students in the learning process, enhancing students' engagement, and improving students' learning. One of the most effective strategies includes utilizing collaborative teamwork. Many undergraduate Electrical and Computer engineering courses include teamwork activities. Group work can offer many benefits, including improving communication and teamwork skills, appreciation and respect for others. However, group work activity sometimes leads students into a challenging experience, especially for students who are not familiar with group activities at university, and may also decrease individual performance. When creating groups, instructors are faced with deciding whether to allow students to form their groups or assign them to groups, whether to switch groups or keep them the same all semester and whether to require students to submit their work individually or as a group. An Electrical Circuits course for major and non-major students is used as a case study. Six Sigma Methodology is implemented to investigate the issues related to students' teamwork experience. A Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) tree is constructed to identify the needs of the students. Potential causes are identified and analyzed using a Fish-bone diagram and 5-whys. Students' performance is used as a quality metric to evaluate the teamwork experience before and after the improvements. We collected students' academic performances based on four exams for more than 70 students over two academic years. New strategies to overcome students' teamwork challenges are ident",

Retention rates are 20% lower in online courses than in traditional face-to-face courses.

The study methodology consisted of an early email contact, distribution of course documents, a follow-up phone call, and a pre-course face-to-face orientation. The retention rate of students who attended the orientation was over 91% with a p-value of 0.9143. The retention rate of students not attending the orientation was just under 18%.

This overabundance challenges workers, placing an increasing premium on skills of sifting through information of sometimes dubious quality, integrating information critically, and producing well‐reasoned conclusions. This paper explores the hypothesis that employers want new hires skilled in ICT literacy, which includes navigating information effectively and using technology efficiently. Based on an ICT literacy framework for higher education, two surveys were created to assess the opinions of human resources (HR) consultants and business school faculty. HR consultants endorsed practically all elements of the framework as being important or essential for new hires. Especially valued were skills associated with information security, confidentiality, and ethical behavior. However, business school faculty did not report a corresponding focus on ICT literacy generally, or ethical/legal issues in particular, in their instruction. The results suggest that while ICT literacy does indeed appear to be among the key skills for today's workforce, much work must still be done to integrate these skills throughout the business school undergraduate curriculum.",

In this chapter, a variety of Web 2.0 applications and their affordances are presented and discussed in relation to constructivism in higher education. The aim is to explain how these applications can be used in higher education to promote interactive and engaging learning environments. Recommendations for harnessing the potential of these tools along with practical examples will assist facilitators of higher education with creative means to design their courses and thus promote Learning 2.0.",

          "abstract": "Distance learning has altered the landscape of higher education, and the rapid proliferation of online courses and programs present new challenges for both faculty and administrators. The literature suggests that faculty must have a wide range of technical and pedagogical skills to be successful online teachers (Betts, 2009; Koehler, Mishra, &amp; Yahya, 2007; Puzziferro &amp; Shelton, 2009). To ensure quality and consistency of online courses, many universities have adopted an industry-standard, quality assurance review framework. In this case, faculty members are required to attend a basic professional development seminar outlining the parts of the rubric and the submission and review process. The study attempts to answer the question: To what extent does the use of an industry-standard, quality assurance rubric for online course evaluation generate any noticeable transformation in the instructional practices of college faculty members? Using the theoretical lens of Transformative Learning Theory (Mezirow, 1991), a qualitative document analysis (Bowen, 2009) was used to examine the Quality Matters™ reviews of 32 online courses. Findings show a high degree of consistency within the course designs, solid alignment between learning outcomes, assignments, and assessments, and standard elements within the course presentations. Using an industry-standard rubric is a good first step for faculty development, but it is not sufficient to produce significant and transformational changes in online teaching practices. The authors suggest a stronger focus on professional development that requires systematic reflection on the design, development, and delivery processes as a way to transform instructional practice.",

Background: Modernizing the IS curriculum is consistently needed to meet the demands of the workplace. The IS2020 curriculum model recommends adding emerging technology learning into the IS curriculum. It presents recommendations for IS programs based on demands from education and the workplace. Methodology: We designed, implemented, and improved a 3D printing assignment that was delivered to sophomore-level and junior-level IS courses with multiple sections. The data was collected over seven semesters. The students were required to complete a survey after completing the printing task. Contribution: The paper has two contributions: (1) it provides IS educators with a recipe to integrate ET skills and knowledge into their pedagogy, and (2) it opens research opportunities for emerging technology to fill the gap in the IS literature. Findings: There was a high completion percentage of printing 3D objects. The student learning was enhanced by user engagement and constructivist knowledge creation. Recommendations for Practitioners: We need to create experiences that can drive deeper thinking about the role of emerging technology. That will grant learners opportunities for reflection on effective organizational use of such technologies. Recommendation for Researchers: Future research can benefit from assessing technology integrations through comparative studies. We suggest focusing on assessing success and failure factors and focusing on learner motivation. Impact on Society: College graduates can benefit from acquiring knowledge and skills in emerging technologies. These graduates can help their employer organizations improve their processes and advance their strategies. Future Research: Research on assessing technology integration in the IS curriculum should be explored. In addition, researchers should investigate th",

IP represents one of the pillars of the economic order and, accordingly, has faced many challenges over the years from a variety of sources. Today, widespread use of digitized IP, primarily via the Internet, is a primary driver of both IP risk and value. This paper proposes a framework for ethical and productive use of digital information in academic settings. It begins with an overview of the fair use doctrine, continues with a literature review illustrating the lack of a framework to help academia with proper Fair Use and, along the way, recommends practical steps that may be taken by institutions of higher education to maximize value added by digital media while minimizing the risk of fair-use litigation.",

Further, although participants saw benefits to integration, including greater engagement of learners, they also spoke of significant obstacles to its implementation, such as teachers' own perceived lack of subject knowledge and a misalignment with the assessment system. The findings, while echoing previous studies conducted in various countries, highlight implementation difficulties in settings where high stake examinations and disciplinary-based curriculum prevail.",

By attending to the intersections of teachers’ beliefs, state policies, and other sociopolitical factors, we aimed to inform scholarship on the teaching of controversial topics and illuminate states’ powers to demarcate the …",

Guided by theories that position curriculum at the intersection of discourse, context, and personal meaning-making, we sought to describe the ways in which intentions for GCE reflect broader societal discourses of citizenship and how curricula allow students to tackle tensions surrounding national and global citizenship. We found that Singapore and Hong Kong have adopted depoliticized forms of citizenship as a means of inoculation against global ills. These types of citizenship are more nationalistic than global in nature; moral rather than political; and focused mainly on utilitarian goals to produce adaptable workers able to support national economic projects in the global economy. Although critical, transnational and other emergent civic perspectives are apparent in both cities, the data yielded little evidence of curricular opportunities for students to become exposed to alternative discourses and reconcile discursive contradictions. The findings inform current literature by illuminating the nexus of local and global discursive practices, implicating the ability of curricula to accommodate both novel and established civic identities, and forwarding suggestions to bridge disconnections between theoretical and local curricular definitions of global citizenship.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been much interest in civic education internationally. As the number of democratic nations increased in Latin America, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe, policy makers have focused on how to instill democratic beliefs and values in youth. In older democracies, policy makers have been concerned about how to stimulate youth civic-political engagement. Within Europe, politicians and educators have been interested in developing a European identity. Additionally, interest in civic education has intensified as a consequence of globalization; national policy makers want to know how their youth “measure up” to peers in other countries in terms of their knowledge in the civic and political arena, as well as in other areas such as literacy, mathematics, and science. Accompanying this multifaceted interest in civic education and civic-political outcomes has been an increase in political socialization research internationally.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, political scientists, political psychologists, and social studies education researchers in the United States (and to a lesser extent Western Europe) studied the processes by which young people acquired their civic-political knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors. At the time, scholars sought to identify the links between particular inputs (messages from family, school, and media) and outputs (student knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors) in the belief these would predict adult orientations (for a review of the early studies see Ehman, 1980). Students were viewed as passive recipients of information about formal political institutions and processes. Since that early period, political …",

In contrast to most countries, the constitutionally democratic state of Singapore explicitly assigns separate citizenship roles to students from different education tracks. Premised on the principle of meritocracy, the Singapore state has also developed separate citizenship education programs incorporating different values, skills, and knowledge for students from the academic and vocational tracks. The study illustrates sharp disparities in how citizenship and democracy is conceptualized by students from the different education tracks. The differences in civic efficacy, learning outcomes, knowledge, and skills also closely parallel the different goals of the social studies and citizenship education …",

A growing body of research suggests that students’ experiences of democratic citizenship education will differ according to how academic programmes, community culture, socio-economic status and gender intersect with prevailing conceptions of equality, mutual respect and reciprocity. This qualitative study explores how democratic citizenship education is enacted in two secondary schools with very dissimilar academic programmes and policies. A key finding in the study is fissures in perceptions of civic engagement and democratic rights between students from the two schools, thus suggesting that academic programmes and policies can differentiate the manner in which students are prepared to fulfil their roles as citizens.",

Finally, we recommend future directions in GCE research and practice. By illuminating empirically grounded studies from Asia and by reconciling these examples with theories of curriculum as discourse, our aim is to contribute to efforts in promoting GCE as a means towards humanistic transformation (UNESCO, 2014) in nation-centric and neoliberal times (Nussbaum, 2010; Torres, 2009).",

To develop this argument, we review theories and critiques of cosmopolitan forms of global citizenship education deemed necessary to prepare young people for complex global social conditions. We discuss cosmopolitan principles on identity, values, and deliberation and draw on critical cosmopolitanism and Asian forms of cosmopolitanism to provide a discursive framework for analyzing curricular intentions in the two cases.",

While much citizenship education has focused on constructions and enactments of GCE in Western societies, this volume re-centers investigations of GCE amid Asian contexts, identities, and practices. In doing so, the contributors to this volume give voice to scholarship grounded in Asia, and the book provides a platform for sharing different approaches, strategies, and research across Asian societies. As nations grapple with how to prepare young citizens to face issues confronting our world, this book expands visions of how GCE might be conceptualized, contextualized, and taught; and how innovative curriculum initiatives and pedagogies can be developed and enacted.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that traditional assessments of democratic participation overlook students' present realities, and fail to capture the knowledge, skills and dispositions necessary to resolve public issues in the twenty-first century. Addressing these concerns, we employed an interpretive perspective in examining students' perceptions of civic competence in one Singaporean school. Analyses of qualitative data reveal students' perceived lack of civic competence to effect systemic change within their school environment and in the larger political arena. This perceived lack of civic competence can be attributed largely to rigid and hierarchical classroom, school and political structures, and the pragmatic focus of Singapore society. We discuss findings in light of civic education research, policy and practice.",

Education reform efforts have reflected curricular and cultural perspectives of dominant national identities and competitiveness in the global market. In various Asian societies, legacies of colonial rule, depoliticized approaches to civic education, and persistent social inequalities further complicate the nature of schooling, teaching, and how students build an understanding of their roles as members of the global community. This chapter provides key findings from literature and case studies to identify classroom practices that support more critical, democratic, and cosmopolitan forms of GCE in Asian societies. In particular, it points to the ways educators in some Asian contexts are able to enact issues-based civic education to address challenges that confront Asian societies, such as the hegemony of neoliberal and …",

Through our analysis of syllabus documents and broader societal discourses, we found several common core values across the two settings that simultaneously represented nationalist and global neoliberal discourses of citizenship. Rather than emphasizing political or civic concerns, curricular and societal discourses worked together to underscore self-management and the creation of orderly national societies attractive to global capital and necessary for economic growth in a competitive global economy. However, we found distinctions in each …",

In surveying studies, we found cosmopolitan principles in traditional values and contemporary definitions of GCE. Although civic education policies tend to be nationalistic and depoliticized, the review yielded variations in orientations towards neoliberal discourses of economic development and the cosmopolitan principles of social transformation and deliberation over public issues. We forward a typology of GCE orientations to capture variations of GCE intentions and discuss enabling discourses in cosmopolitan GCE. The chapter concludes by revisiting how global discourses are challenging nation-centric conceptions of citizenship and by pointing to future directions in GCE research and practice.",

An operating agency seeks to minimize operating costs while maintaining the quality of service while users experience costs associated with scheduling, waiting, and traveling within the system. In this paper, an analytical model is employed to approximate the agency's operating cost for running a DRT system with dynamic demand and the total generalized cost that users experience as a result of the operating decisions. The approach makes use of Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory to model the dynamics of the DRT system in the equilibrium condition and approximate the generalized cost for users when the operating capacity is inadequate to serve the time-dependent demand over the peak period without excess delay. The efficiency of the DRT system can be improved by optimizing …",

In this research, we design an optimal lane management strategy for corridors with a heterogeneous demand of human-driven, autonomous, and communicant autonomous vehicles (HVs, AVs, and CAVs). In a monocentric city setting, we dynamically control the inflow of the network by optimizing the size of CAV platoons in the corridors based on the instantaneous condition of the integrated system. These corridors can potentially have three types of lanes for vehicles with different levels of automation technology. We model the multiple lane type corridors as sets of parallel bottlenecks with general distributions of multiclass demand. The dynamics of the congestion in the network is also modeled using the macroscopic network fundamental diagram …",

In the transportation network, there is a diversity of different factors that can influence the decisions of the users, while the relative importance of these factors varies among the heterogeneous users with different trip purposes. Nonetheless, the cumulative result of the individual decisions of the users seeking to minimize their costs according to their own preferences leads to the user equilibrium condition in which no one can reduce his/her cost by changing his/her decision. In this research, we adapt the concept of the efficient frontier from portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952) in finance in order to model the bicriterion choice behavior of users with heterogeneous preferences in transportation networks. We show that the efficient frontier has a set of primary properties that remains general in different problems. Thus, the primary properties of the efficient frontier can be employed to analytically model and solve different bicriterion choice problems in transportation. For the first application, we use these properties to propose an analytical model for the morning commute problem when there is a heterogeneity associated with preferences of the users (Vickrey, 1969; Daganzo, 1985). A dynamic pricing strategy is also proposed to optimize the bottleneck by minimizing the total cost for users. In addition to the morning commute problem, Vickrey’s congestion theory is also shown to have applications in modeling and optimizing the operation of the demand responsive transit …",

However, we show there is a tradeoff between the operational capacity and the battery loss of CAVs at intersections. This research aims to enhance the battery life of CAVs with the minimum impact on operational capacity. To this end, we develop a stochastic model for the battery-capacity loss of CAV platoons at signal-free intersections. We account for the stochasticity in traffic operations at intersections by considering a probability distribution for the operational error in synchronizing the arrival and departure of consecutive platoons in crossing directions. We then balance the tradeoff between the battery-capacity loss rate and intersection capacity by optimizing the platoon size, traffic speed, and marginal gap length at a macroscopic scale.

These ideas have been discussed for many years but for much of this time, the required technology was not available to make them a reality.

As the transition to a complete automated system is still in progress, this leaves many questions that still need to be answered as well as allowing for novel solutions to be presented. Using modern research papers to formulate a sound basis in current automated highway systems research, novel solutions are presented for various problems still existing in this field.",

The study suggests the benefit of AsianCrit as a theoretical, methodological tool to read and disrupt racism embedded in curriculum scripting of U.S. history.

Qualitative analysis resulted in four distinct categories: (a) support at home (68.8%), (b) home–school connection (17.7%), (c) participation in school (5.0%), and (d) duty (8.5%). The category of support at home was divided into three subcategories: Support of nonacademic development (31.9%), support of emotional psychological development (29.1%), and support of academic success (7.8%).

During the semester prior to their student teaching, 16 candidates at a large public university in the southeastern U.S. enrolled in four content methods courses. Taught by the authors of this article, the curriculum of these courses emphasized social justice dimensions of teaching rather than just focusing on skills and strategies.

Our data analysis demonstrates that Korean immigrant students face varying difficulties in constructing meaning in US history and engaging themselves in social studies learning, which results in a negative learning experience and subsequent disinterest in social studies.

Asian Americans are an extraordinarily diverse group of people, yet are often viewed through stereotypical lenses: as Chinese or Japanese only, as recent immigrants who do not speak English, as exotic foreigners, or as a “model minority” who do well in school. This fundamental misperception of who Asian Americans are begins with young learners―often from what they learn, or do not learn, in school. This book sets out to amend the superficial treatment of Asian American histories in U.S. textbooks and curriculum by providing elementary teachers with a more nuanced, thematically driven account.

To minimize its negative impact on international tourism, the underlying psychological mechanisms of Chinese tourists associated with this complex political issue should be determined. As an attempt to resolve the current crisis, this study identified the subjective characteristics of Chinese tourists who cancelled visits to Korea using Q-methodology and classified Chinese tourists’ attitude towards the THAAD issue. Based on respondent’s evaluations on Q-sample statements, four types of Chinese tourists were articulated, namely, patriotism, risk awareness, external dependency, and Lotte sanctions. By delving into tourists’ subjectivity, Q-methodology seems powerful to elicit intrapersonal constraints, which are deeply embedded in an individual’s psychological state. The results showed that the THAAD issue greatly influenced Chinese tourists’ personal values, beliefs, and identities.",

Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention were evaluated, and qualitative feedback was collected. Preliminary treatment effects of adding the Recovery vodcasts were assessed, including eating disorder pathology, anxiety and depression symptoms, and body mass index.</i> <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> <i>The Recovery vodcasts were acceptable for patients with AN. The patients' psychopathologies of eating disorders improved with augmentation of the vodcasts in their first-line treatments.

To answer this question, we conducted a content analysis of the presentation of U.S. history in middle school social studies textbooks used in South Korean schools. Our findings show that (1) South Korea's textbook accounts of U.S. history predominantly portray the United States as a world leader in democracy and peace building; (2) the textbook accounts of U.S. history generally miss the events and figures that have historical significance for U.S. domestic contexts; and (3) the history of controversial U.S.–Korea relations as well as learning opportunities for historical thinking are also missing in the textbook accounts.",

Drawing on in-depth interviews with Korean high school students studying in the US, this paper suggests that   while the core meaning of study abroad   may be strategic interests within the global economy, the pragmatic instrumentalism and neoliberal ethos toward education and global citizenship can be challenged. Most significant factors identified in the study are: 1) social studies curriculum that challenges   international students’   desires of strategic cosmopolitanism  , and 2) a school culture that encourages young international students to mix with other races/cultures and reconsider their pre-migration views.   The paper offers a discussion on how both sending and receiving countries of young international students can support them to become citizens concerned not just with their strategic positioning within the global economy but also with building a moral sense of global solidarity.",

These systems utilize solid-state ceramic oxides which offer enhanced stability, fuel flexibility, and high energy conversion efficiency throughout operation. However, the nature of system conditions, such as high temperatures, complex redox atmosphere, and presence of volatile reactive species become taxing on solid oxide materials and limit their viability during long-term operation. Ongoing research efforts to identify the material corrosion and degradation phenomena, as well as discover possible mitigation techniques to extend material efficiency and longevity, is the current focus of the research and industrial community. In this review, degradation processes in select solid oxide electrochemical systems, system components, and comprising materials will be discussed. Overall degradation phenomena are presented and certain degradation mechanisms are discussed. State-of-the-art technologies to mitigate or minimize the above-mentioned degradation processes are presented.",

Ideally, excess renewable energy generated during times of plenty can be stored in hydrogen and batteries for use during periods of insufficient electricity availability. Excess electricity from renewables can be fed into an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen and later used in fuel cells to produce electricity when needed, releasing the stored energy back to the grid.

          "abstract": "Fundamental understanding of the degradation processes pertinent to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes remains important in order to apply innovative approaches to achieve long-term electrical performance stability and establish long-term systems reliability for mass commercialization. Several processes leading to an increase in the cathode polarization including Nernst and ohmic losses have been identified. The processes include solid-solid and solid-gas interactions among electrochemically active and inactive components of the cell, stack and systems. The cathodic degradation in SOFCs remains most prominent, and the present review focuses on the effects of contaminants present in “real world” air such as H2O, CO2, and trace amounts of SOx on cathode performance. This review also studies the interactions of the cathode with chromium vapor evaporated from high-temperature alloys used in balance …",

Changes in the oxide morphology and chemistry from the alloys representing chromia former (602CA), alumina former (H214), and mixed chromia and alumina scale formers (AFA25) at 900°C and 1100°C during exposure to humidified air have been studied and are presented. It is found that the rate of Cr evaporation from the alloys decreases in the order of 602CA followed by Haynes 214 and AFA25 at 850°C during exposure to humidified air.

High-resolution triple axis x-ray measurement demonstrated pseudomorphic and high-quality Ge epitaxial layer on crystallographically oriented GaAs substrates. The cross-sectional TEM exhibited a sharp interface between the Ge epilayer and each orientation of the GaAs substrate as well as the Al2O3 film and the Ge epilayer. The extracted valence band offset, ΔEv, values of Al2O3 relative to (100), (110), and (111) Ge orientations using XPS measurement were 3.17 eV, 3.34 eV, and 3.10 eV, respectively. Using XPS data, variations in ΔEv related to the crystallographic orientation were ΔEV(110)Ge&amp;gt;ΔEV(100)Ge≥ΔEV(111)Ge and the conduction band offset, ΔEc, related to the crystallographic orientation was ΔEc(111)Ge&amp;gt;ΔEc(110)Ge&amp;gt;ΔEc(100)Ge using the measured ΔEv, bandgap of Al2O3 in each orientation, and well-known Ge bandgap of 0.67 eV.

The electrochemical performance of half-cells in Cr-containing humid air atmosphere and in the presence of the chromium getter also remained stable during 100-h tests at 550 and 650 degrees C, respectively. The post-test structural and chemical analysis of the electrode, electrode-electrolyte interface and getter by scanning- transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and Raman spectroscopy showed that the cathode bulk and cathode- electrolyte interface remained free of chromium deposits whereas chromium species deposited near the air inlet region of the porous getter as crystalline SrCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.",

The getter material, however, remains prone to chemical and structural changes in humid environments. Experimental observations indicate that Sr is segregated by absorbing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules and the resulting Sr-deficient phase is transformed into SrNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Investigations reveal that the Sr-segregation is attributed not only to the hygroscopic nature of Sr but also to the compressive stress and 1D arrangement of Sr-ions in the structure. The formation of Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∙8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O by moisture absorption accompanies volume expansion, resulting in crack formation. To improve the resistance to moisture attack, the surface is modified with SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-treatment. Experimental observations confirm that the SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; passivation layer effectively restrains the moisture absorption and accompanied structural changes. The Cr-gettering capability of the SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer on strontium nickel oxide is experimentally and thermodynamically verified.",

Before any kind of therapeutic approach can be used, it is necessary that such biomarkers be detected at a minimum concentration in the bodily fluids. Here, we report the fabrication of an interdigitated sensing device integrated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers and carbon nanotubes (CNT) for the detection of an inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP). The limit of detection (LOD) was achieved in a range of 100 ng mL−1 and 1 fg mL−1 in both phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and human serum (hs). Furthermore, a significant change in the electrochemical impedance from 45% to 70% (hs) and 38% to 60% (PBS) over the loading range of CRP was achieved. The finite element analysis indicates that a non-redox charge transduction at the solid/liquid interface on the electrode surface is responsible for the enhanced sensitivity. Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor consists of a large electro-active surface area, along with better charge transfer characteristics that enabled improved specific binding with CRP. This was determined both experimentally and from the simulated electrochemical impedance of the PVA nanofiber patterned gold electrode.",

Phase identification and its evolution has been examined using high temperature in-situ X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) whereas thermal stability and morphology of compounds have been studied using XRD in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Synthesized SrxNiyOz powder remains stable up to 900°C in air, whereas exposure above 950°C leads to its dissociation into separate SrO and NiO phases. Presence of SrO in powder reacts with H2O and CO2, present in atmospheric air, resulting into pulverization due to volume change and the formation of hydroxides and carbonates. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the pulverized powders show approximately 20% weight loss due to the evaporation of hydroxyl and carbonate groups. Chemical stability of SrxNiyOz is considered essential in order to prevent pulverization and flaking of the getter coating applied over ceramic honeycomb or foam substrates. Chromium getter is considered a cost effective and reliable means to mitigate cathode poisoning in high temperature electrochemical systems such as solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) and oxygen transport membranes (OTM).",

Railroad infrastructure includes rail tracks, contact cables, catenary cables, return current cables, masts, and cantilevers. The LIDAR dataset used in this study is acquired by placing an Optech Lynx mobile mapping system on a railcar, operating at 125 km/h. The acquired dataset covers 550 meters of Austrian rural railroad corridor comprising 31 railroad key elements and containing only spatial information. The proposed methodology recognizes key components of the railroad corridor based on their physical shape, geometrical properties, and the topological relationships among them. The developed algorithms managed to recognize all key components of the railroad infrastructure, including two rail tracks, thirteen masts, thirteen cantilevers, one contact cable, one catenary cable, and one return current cable. The results are presented and discussed both at object level and at point cloud level. The results indicate that 100% accuracy and 100% precision at the object level and an average of 96.4% accuracy and an average of 97.1% precision at point cloud level are achieved.",

          "abstract": "We present a method for detecting and modelling rails in mobile laser scanner data. The detection is based on the properties of the rail tracks and contact wires such as relative height, linearity and relative position with respect to other objects. Points classified as rail track are used in a 3D modelling algorithm. The modelling is done by first fitting a parametric model of a rail piece to the points along each track, and estimating the position and orientation parameters of each piece model. For each position and orientation parameter a smooth low-order Fourier curve is interpolated. Using all interpolated parameters a mesh model of the rail is reconstructed. The method is explained using two areas from a dataset acquired by a LYNX mobile mapping system in a mountainous area. Residuals between railway laser points and 3D models are in the range of 2 cm. It is concluded that a curve fitting algorithm is essential to reliably and accurately model the rail tracks by using the knowledge that railways are following a continuous and smooth path.",

The employed dataset covers 630 m of the Dutch urban railroad corridors in which there are four rail tracks, two contact cables, and two catenary cables. The dataset includes only geometrical information (three dimensional (3D) coordinates of the points) with no intensity data and no RGB data. The obtained results indicate that all objects of interest are successfully classified at the object level with no false positives and no false negatives. The results also show that an average 97.3% precision and an average 97.7% accuracy at the point cloud level are achieved. The high precision and high accuracy of the rail track classification (both greater than 96%) at the point cloud level stems from the great impact of the employed template matching method on excluding the false positives. The cables also achieve quite high average precision (96.8%) and accuracy (98.4%) due to their high sampling and isolated position in the railroad corridor.",

The employed dataset is acquired by a Velodyne HDL 32E and covers 155 m of a subway tunnel containing six million points. First, the tunnel’s main axis and cross sections are extracted. Next, a preliminary model is created by fitting an ellipse to each extracted cross section. The model is refined by employing residual analysis and Baarda’s data snooping method to eliminate outliers. The final model is then generated by applying least squares adjustment to outlier-free data. The obtained results indicate that the tunnel’s main axis and 1551 cross sections at 0.1 m intervals are successfully extracted. Cross sections have an average semi-major axis of 7.8508 m with a standard deviation of 0.2 mm and semi-minor axis of 7.7509 m with a standard deviation of 0.1 mm. The average normal distance of points from the constructed model (average absolute error) is also 0.012 m. The developed algorithm is applicable to tunnels with any horizontal orientation and degree of curvature since it makes no assumptions, nor does it use any a priori knowledge regarding the tunnel’s curvature and horizontal orientation.",

The algorithm is improved by: (1) making it applicable to railroads with any slope; (2) employing Eigen decomposition for the rail seed point selection that makes it independent of the rails’ dimensions; and (3) developing a computationally efficient fully data-driven method (simultaneous identification of rail tracks and contact cables) that is able to process poorly sampled datasets with complicated configurations. The upgraded algorithm is applied to two datasets with quite different point sampling and complexity. First dataset is scanned by a terrestrial system and contains three million points covering 630 m of an inter-city railroad corridor. It presents a simple configuration with nonintersecting straight rail tracks and cables. Second dataset includes 80 m of a complex urban railroad environment comprising curved and merging rail tracks and intersecting cables. It is scanned from an airborne platform and contains 165,000 points. The results indicate that all objects of interest are identified and the average recognition precision and accuracy of both datasets at the point cloud level are greater than 95%.",

This research aims to create such a 3D as-built plan using terrestrial LiDAR data while in this paper the aim is to extract insulators, which are key objects in electrical substations. This paper proposes a segmentation method based on a new approach of finding the principle direction of points’ distribution. This is done by forming and analysing the distribution matrix whose elements are the range of points in 9 different directions in 3D space. Comparison of the computational performance of our method with PCA (principal component analysis) shows that our approach is 25% faster since it utilizes zero-order moments while PCA computes the first- and second-order moments, which is more time-consuming. A knowledge-based approach has been developed to automatically recognize points on insulators. The method utilizes known insulator properties such as diameter and the number and the spacing of their rings. The results achieved indicate that 24 out of 27 insulators could be recognized while the 3 un-recognized ones were highly occluded. Check point analysis was performed by manually cropping all points on insulators. The results of check point analysis show that the accuracy, precision and recall of insulator recognition are 98%, 86% and 81%, respectively.

Flight parameters and weather conditions were the same on each site. The outputs were orthomosaics and digital surface models, whose accuracies were inspected by descriptive statistics and variance analysis tools. The data of the ultralight drone on the first site could not be processed due to strong wind, but its results for the second site (11 hectares) were comparable to those of survey-grade drones, i.e., the range and average of checkpoint errors for Mini2 were 0.17 m and 0.04 m, respectively, while those were 0.10 m and 0.02 m for Phantom4 and Mavic3E. In the third site (34 hectares), survey-grade drones produced accurate results with a checkpoint error range of 0.26 m, while that was 0.87 m for the ultralight drone, implying lower accuracy results. The results obtained suggest that ultralight drones under certain circumstances can produce reliable mapping products depending on weather conditions, the number and distribution of ground control points, and area size. Their biggest drawback is their vulnerability to wind, and in calm weather conditions, due to non-RTK error accumulation, their mapping accuracy degenerates as the area size increases.",

          "abstract": "Tunnels must be regularly monitored to meet safety requirements and to prevent excessive deformation or displacement. Tunnels are currently monitored by measuring a few benchmarks using total stations or other surveying instruments. These techniques are effective and precise, but also slow and expensive. In the case of rail tunnels, for example, the regular train schedule is disrupted whenever land surveyors have to operate inside the tunnel. This article presents a novel automated method for the geometric modelling of tunnels from mobile Lidar point clouds with sub-millimetre precision. The models can be employed for maintenance, project management and enhancement of future designs.",

          "abstract": "This study presents an innovative automated methodology for identification of electrical substations’ key elements from 3D LiDAR point clouds acquired by terrestrial laser scanners. The developed methodology is composed of nine algorithms that identify objects of interest with respect to their physical shape and topological relationships among them. The objects of interest in this contribution are ground, fence, cables, circuit breakers, bushings, bus pipes, insulators, and three types of poles with circular, octagonal, and square cross sectional shape. The developed methodology incorporates a computationally-efficient algorithm for detection of ground within electrical substations; two separate algorithms for identifying well-sampled and poorly-sampled fences; robust algorithms for detecting cables, circuit breakers, and bushings with respect to their unique physical shape and the topological relationships among them; and a novel method for simultaneous identification, modeling, and registration-refinement of poles with circular and regular polygonal cross sectional shapes. The proposed methods in this study work quite robustly despite the challenges introduced by non-uniform point sampling, registration error, occlusion, attached objects, gap, dense configuration of neighboring objects, and outliers. Five datasets with quite different volume and configuration were employed in this work. The first three datasets contain point clouds of two different electrical substations. The fourth and fifth datasets contain point clouds of an urban roadway and a pole-like monument with a regular dodecagonal cross section, respectively. The obtained results indicate that 367 out of 382 objects of interest (96.1%) in the first dataset; 354 out of 382 objects of interest (92.7%) in the second dataset; and 255 out of 264 objects of interest (96.6%) in the third dataset were successfully recognized. At point cloud level, it achieved greater than 99%, 96%, and 97% average recognition ",

Nineteen K-8 teachers in the USA, who were new to teaching engineering as part of a shift in science learning standards, participated. We focused on four areas of engineering practice and epistemology, namely the orientation of engineering toward solutions, the role of context in defining engineering design specifications, the role and nature of data and evidence, and the interdisciplinary nature of science and engineering. Comparisons of changes in teachers’ incorporation of epistemic practices show some reflection of changes in their views about the nature of engineering knowledge. Comparisons suggest that they were able to design instruction …",

Project-based STEM units about environmental issues like water quality offer the possibility to create more expansive, equitable learning experiences. These units can leverage local problems and resources while also including the global dimensions of the issue to provide meaningful opportunities for diverse student sensemaking. However, even project-based STEM learning requires explicit attention to the agency of teachers, students, and place. In order to identify a set of design principles for supporting equitable learning in a project-based STEM curriculum, this manuscript brings together a set of empirical and theoretical frameworks including teacher participatory relationship with the curriculum, culturally sustaining pedagogy, critical pedagogy of place, and equitable sensemaking. The authors use these frameworks to describe a conceptual model of Participatory Relationship of Students, Communities, Teachers, Curriculum and Place. Then, the manuscript outlines a set of seven design principles that connect to the theoretical frameworks to the conceptual model and provide implementation strategies with examples of how we apply these design principles to a project-based STEM unit for 4–8 grade students. The design principles have implications for design of future project-based units and learning opportunities for teachers and students.",

In this qualitative study, we consider how 31 elementary teachers use the CCCs in their planning for three-dimensional learning and how the teachers describe their successes, challenges, and use of the CCCs in their classrooms. The teachers engaged in a week-long professional development focused on writing three-dimensional lesson plans with an explicit focus on the use of the CCCs in elementary classrooms. Our analyses showed that all the lesson plans included use of the CCCs to support students’ 3D sensemaking. However, certain CCCs were used more than others and explicit use of the CCCs by students was uncommon. In addition, a mismatch existed between what CCCs the teachers claimed to use in their lesson plans and what was used in their lessons. In describing their successes and challenges with use of the CCCs in the classroom, the teachers typically discussed students’ experiences and knowledge with the CCCs.

However, in a comprehensive review, Gaudin and Chaliès (2015) identified critical questions about video use that remain unanswered and need to be explored through research in teacher education. A critical question they ask is, “How can teaching teachers to identify and interpret relevant classroom events on video clips improve their capacity to perform the same activities in the classroom?” (p. 57). This paper shares the efforts of a collaborative of science teacher educators from nine teacher preparation programs working to answer this question. In particular, we provide an overview of a theoretically-constructed video analysis framework and demonstrate how that framework has guided the design of pedagogical tools and video-based learning experiences both within and across a variety of contexts. These contexts include both undergraduate and graduate science teacher preparation programs, as well as elementary and secondary science methods and content courses. Readers will be provided a window into the planning and enactment of video analyses in these different contexts, as well as insights from the assessment and research efforts that are exploring the impact of the integration of video analysis in each context.",

This research analyzes the teaching practices supported by tools used in two different science methods courses over a three year period. The study revealed themes in the teaching practices that were supported by the tools and the ways in which the tools might facilitate teachers to engage in the tasks of teaching. This work has implications for more purposeful analysis, development, adaptation, and use of tools for supporting beginning teachers to learn and enact the nuanced, complex ambitious teaching that supports student sensemaking in science.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in science practices integrated with content facilitates deeper learning of science and is called for by new reforms. Supporting this science learning requires complex teaching that is not common in U.S. classrooms. Given this complexity, beginning elementary teachers need support in learning to engage students in science practices such as constructing evidence-based claims about natural phenomena. A practice-based approach to teacher education, focused on making teaching practice core to professional learning, has been suggested to support beginning teacher development. This approach has shown potential in supporting secondary science teachers’ learning, yet little is known about how it might support preservice elementary teachers’ learning over time. \\n\\nThis dissertation addresses this gap by investigating the change in preservice teachers’ teaching practices and knowledge for supporting elementary students in constructing evidence-based claims during a practice-based elementary teacher education program. Using longitudinal qualitative methodology, this study drew on video-records, lesson plans, class assignments, and surveys from one cohort of 54 interns enrolled in a two-year coherent practice-based teacher education program. A subset of five focal interns was followed closely throughout the program. \\nThe preservice teachers grew in their ability to support elementary students to construct evidence-based claims incrementally by adding components of the teaching practice over time. Specifically, the teachers typically developed the ability to support students to analyze data earlier than they developed the ability to support students to justify their claims. However, they faced challenges during student teaching in consistently supporting students to construct evidence-based claims. These challenges may be due to the removal of scaffolding in the face of the complexity of fulltime teaching.\\n\\nThe findings highlight the potential of a coherent practice",

The researchers used qualitative methods to analyze PSTs' responses to a questionnaire about CCCs in three-dimensional learning and think-aloud interviews with nine PSTs about this questionnaire. The PSTs' responses suggest patterns and variations in their selection and justification of CCCs in relation to different scientific phenomena. These analyses highlight how different individuals likely see different CCCs as having \"exploratory power\" for the related phenomena and DCIs. The findings suggest that the knowledge required for effective teaching of CCCs as part of three-dimensional learning is complex and multifaceted. The study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of elementary PSTs' understanding of CCCs and has the implications for supporting three-dimensional learning and teaching.",

Results of the study revealed both expected and unexpected insights that indicate topics for further research. From the faculty survey, there may be a positive effect of faculty involvement in the creation and adoption process on their perception of the OER, and the relationship between faculty perceptions of student engagement and students’ actual academic achievement may not be a close one. From the student survey, students’ actual use of OER is about as inconsistent as their use of traditional commercial textbooks, students’ use of supplementary resources has a positive effect on their perception of the OER as long as they choose to use them, and students’ interest in an OER and their perception of its quality do not appear to be related.",

These publications were analyzed using the ideal speech communication situation, a theory developed by the German social philosopher, Jürgen Habermas. Within these texts, the existence and influence of distorted communication, as defined by Habermas, indicates when and where open, free communication broke down and influenced the course of scientific discussion. This dissertation’s analysis of the articles from 1967 shows that the publications contained communicative distortion, and the communicative distortion provides more than enough reason to doubt both the scientific validity of the reported LSD-chromosome damage and LSD-birth defects links and the reasoning behind the scientific consensus emerging at the end of 1967 that LSD did cause chromosome damage and birth defects. In terms of technical communication scholarship, this dissertation’s analysis demonstrates that Habermas’s theory of the ideal speech communication situation can be used as an analytical tool for rhetoric of science studies and contribute to the further development of the field.",

          "abstract": "The cost of college textbooks has skyrocketed over the past forty years. From 1978 through 2015, their prices went up by 987%; by comparison, the Consumer Price Index went up 266% over that same timespan (Perry, 2015), meaning textbooks' prices went up nearly four times as fast as other prices. Data from the 2022–23 academic year reveals that students spend an average of $1240 on books and supplies (CollegeData. com).\nAll interested parties--students, governments, and instructors alike--are all pushing back. Students often rent textbooks, and many others simply do not procure the required textbooks for their classes. Governments at both the federal and state level offer grants to lower the costs of textbooks (SPARC, 2016). Instructors have begun to develop open educational resources (OER).",

The average college student spends somewhere between $600 and $1200 annually on textbooks (College, 2015; National, 2016), and many students rebel by not purchasing required textbooks, especially for courses outside their major.\nThe engineers and computer science students who populate the TCOM 2010 course at KSU exemplify this problem.

We decided to center our research on the effect of salt in yeast production. Therefore, we chose to use different amounts of salt concentrations in our experiment to determine whether the difference in concentrations would have an effect on ethanol production. We hypothesized that having a smaller salt concentration will result in an elevated amount of ethanol production. We then compared the ethanol production between two different experimental groups one containing 2g of salt and the other 4g of salt. Based off our results our hypothesis was unsupported, and more ethanol was produced in a higher salt concentration.",

In the late nineteenth century, testimony became a common feature of literary works both fact and fiction. But with the rise of new journalism, the power of testimony could be undermined by anonymous, institutional voices—a Victorian subversion which continues to this day. Testimony on Trial examines the conflicts over testimony through the eyes of two of its major combatants, Joseph Conrad and Henry James. Brian Artese finds an overlooked yet direct inspiration for Heart of Darkness in the anti-testimonial scheming of Henry Morton Stanley and the New York Herald. Through new readings of works including Lord Jim and The Portrait of a Lady, Artese demonstrates how the cultural conditions that worked against testimony fed into a nascent conflict about the meaning of modernism itself.",

I argue that sympathetic penetration in the novel has always been torn in a battle between the implications of confession and testimony. Although James rejects testimonial narration in the novel because it lacks \"authority,\" his fiction vigorously argues that one has a right, socially, to maintain the non-transparent diplomatic \"front\" that is the testimonial condition. In terms of his \"international theme,\" James sees this right as taken for granted in Europe, whereas American culture is more likely to demand from an individual the perpetual \"transparency\" championed by the eighteenth-century sentimentalists.",

Grounding his central argument in the Lacanian concept of the “object-voice,” Maisonnat seeks in Conrad’s work what he calls a “textual voice” peculiar to literary expression. It is not precisely a voice of the unconscious “because it is a function of the signifier, located within language itself,” and operates beyond the control or instigation of anything at the level of the symbolic. The textual voice is primarily disruptive of the authorial voice,“which consciously appeals to reason and emotions.” Challenging “the construction of clear meaning,” the function of the textual voice is to “sublimate effects when they threaten to overwhelm character, narrator, author alike, and therefore readers too”(35–36).\nThese disturbances emerge primarily through competitions of voice and genre within the …",

While many of the technological advancements in recent decades have been of tremendous benefit, some have created new forms of hazards for the safety and health of mankind. As a result, safety and health issues have played a key role in many fields of engineering and engineering technology. This is especially true in the Biomedical Engineering field whose growth rate has outpaced other traditional engineering disciplines in recent years. In the health care industry, patient safety and health issues lead to many injuries and death with resulting litigation every year. Even though the importance of health and safety considerations is well established for many fields of engineering, it is not taught as an integral part of most engineering or engineering technology curricula, and is not tested as part of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) or Professional Engineering (PE) licensing exams 1. The recognized importance of safety and health in engineering, however, has led to the development of relatively new degrees in Safety Engineering. The Electrical Engineering Technology (EET) program at Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) has recently instituted an option in Biomedical Engineering Technology (BMET). Recognizing the inherent hazards to health and safety in the medical environment, a required course in Health Care Safety was included in the curriculum.

This is especially true for those educational institutions that offer programs in the engineering technologies, engineering, and computer related fields. Since the graduates from these institutions form the pool of new employees for industry, it is important that industry contributes ideas on the preparation of the graduates. Industry constantly functions at the cutting edge of technology. As such, it can be expected that suggestions from industry will be based on the current technological applications. In order for graduates to be sufficiently well prepared for the workplace, they will need to be instructed on the latest developments in industry. It is for these reasons that many programs utilize Industrial Advisory Committees who can provide an industrial perspective to the institutions. These committees form an essential component to the administration of academic programs. Due to, the more complex nature of the telecommunications equipment these days, the current industry requirement calls for a change of emphasis in the preparation of graduates. While they still need to understand the equipment in terms of how they function and how to assemble them, it has become paramount that the graduates are proficient in operating the equipment.

Recent and ongoing advances in communication technology, has led to an explosion in distance delivery methods and techniques. This has provided academic institutions with the much-needed opportunity to reach remote audiences with their program offerings.\nA review of established distance delivery techniques reveals that compressed video and the use of the Internet are the most prevalent techniques employed by academic institutions throughout the nation. In the case of delivering highly technical content, it appears that interactive classroom instruction is still the preferred means of delivery. As a result, the Engineering Technology Division at Florida A&M University (FAMU) has chosen to use compressed video with taped backup in an interactive instructional setting as the preferred means of delivering its technical courses to its satellite campuses around the state of Florida. This paper presents the experiences gained at FAMU in delivering a course in computer-aided circuit analysis to students at one of its satellite campus through distance delivery.

In recent times, information has become a commodity that all people require in their professional lives, for entertainment as well as personal use. More and more educational institutions and libraries are employing computers to facilitate their activities in educational scholarship. Factors such as these establish the functionality of the computer as an essential requirement in the lives of all people who need to use information. The context of digital divide focuses on the separation between those who have easy access to computer facilities and those who do not. It is established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that minorities, low-income persons, the less educated and children of single-parent household are some of those who are most affected by the lack of access to information resources particularly when they reside in rural areas or central cities. It can be argued that these are some of the very parties who need such facilities for personal development. The digital divide is thus a gulf that must be bridged if there is to be some form of equity in the aspirations of all people in the society. With many academic institutions now requiring that their students each own a computer as a basic tool for use during their college education, this paper will attempt to examine the impact of such requirements on minority students, students from low-income families, and those who are attempting to work and pay their own way through college.",

Unlike existing systems, SMA-01 overcomes limitations such as limited use, low reliability in low light conditions, and lack of recipient identification. The hardware support involves an infrared module, RFID reader, and GSM module powered by a 9V battery. Successful experiments on various mailboxes validate its effectiveness. The software support includes libraries for serial communication, SPI, and RFID. SMA-01 represents a significant leap in secure and efficient mail handling.

Using volunteer participants, these experiments focus on how brain waves correlate with results from gameplay and with external factors influencing the outcomes. When gathering data on attention and distraction, participants engage in several mini-games, with their environment changing each round. Specifically, in data capturing, EMOTIV hardware and software are used for wave capturing and MATLAB is used to process the data in graphical form to identify noticeable impacts.

          "abstract": "Abstract Manual wire cutting with poorly designed manual wire cutters presents many work-related health issues for electricians. Repetitively cutting wires with such tools can result in injuries to the hands and wrists of the individual. Additionally, manual wire cutting can be inaccurate and is time consuming, which can represent a loss of revenue from the time utilized in the process. Automatic wire cutting machines help to significantly reduce the number of occupational injuries, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of wire cutting. There are a variety of industrial wire cutting and stripping machines on the market. Unfortunately, these machines are expensive and many electrical contractors and small technical shops cannot afford them. As a result, old and outdated automatic wire cutting machines are widely utilized by technicians, manufacturing workers and electrical contractors. These machines are not very efficient and tend to be slower in operation and are subject to technical issues such as jamming. As a result of empirical observations and personal experiences with manual wire cutters and old automatic wire cutting machines, a team of students in the EET Senior Capstone Design Project course at ________ _____ University embarked on the design of a cost-effective industrial wire cutting machine with the goal of improving productivity, performance, accuracy, ease of use, and maintainability while at the same time reducing the cost of manufacturing such a machine. Their design utilizes a spool of wire of the type in automation assembly plant processes, an Arduino microcontroller, and other hardware components such as an LCD screen, push buttons, power supply, motor driver, servo motor, DC motor and DC-to-DC step-down converters. C/C++ functions were developed for the software portion of the project. This paper presents preliminary results from their design project.

Through recent modifications and additions to the course content offered by the ECE and EET programs at __________ _____ University, the Capstone Design course experience now includes a component the seeks to encourage the development of entrepreneurial skills in the for our Capstone Design Students. In this paper we will present the design of an innovative Hands-Free Computer Controller (MouseHead), that was designed for use by individuals with physical impairments and disabilities. The paper also discusses some of the entrepreneurial aspects that were incorporated in the course through design process, and preliminary results from the project will be presented. The limitations experienced by individuals with impairments and disabilities create many difficulties for those individuals, especially their ability to use certain technology. With technology being such a driving force in society, more opportunities are created for those who are not able to leave their homes as easily. Individuals with impairments such as amputees, and paraplegics, need alternate ways of operating computers. Using mouse controls and typing may be difficult for those individuals those with limited to no arm control which eliminates an avenue they could use for work and improving their lifestyle. MouseHead is designed to address this problem. It provides users the ability to control their computer using a combination of head movement, blinking, voice control, and simple gestures.

          "abstract": "Abstract Even under normal conditions, it can be challenging to utilize online or distance learning environments to offer technical degree programs such as Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) or Electrical Engineering Technology (EET). These programs normally require hands-on-laboratory expositions (albeit in 2D) to help students grasp the complex concepts and to develop their practical skills and competencies. The COVID-19 Pandemic has exposed teaching institutions and faculty in some of these technical disciplines to a myriad of these challenges. The unanticipated switch from face-to-face course offerings to online virtual Remote course offerings in and around March of 2020 forced many teaching faculty to come face-to-face with the realities, and challenges of teaching Remotely and Virtually, most of whom had hitherto not been teaching online. Academic institutions have also had to deal with the abrupt switch and have had to provide facilities, resources, and services to assist their faculty as they make the necessary changes to their courses. In this paper, a thorough examination and discussion of some of the challenges that faculty teaching in highly technical disciplines in ECE and ET programs at __________ _____ University have had to face, and are still dealing with, are provided. In particular, the paper looks at instruction for typical ECE Problem-Based-Learning course such as Capstone Design course, and a highly mathematical Systems and Systems Analysis course in ET. Meaningful recommendations as to how to avoid some of the pitfalls encountered and how to make the course more accessible and meaningful for the students will be presented.

          "abstract": "Abstract Abstract The Senior Capstone Design Project course has traditionally been used to train students of engineering with practical skills and prepare them for real engineering life. Engineering technology (ET) programs, on the other hand, have always claimed to offer hands-on, practical real-world engineering training for their students and graduates. This is usually achieved through structured laboratory based courses and project based learning courses throughout their curriculum. In the EET program at __________ _____ University, the Capstone Design course experience was offered through a menu of project-based senior design courses that students got to choose from based on their specific electrical areas of interest. This served the program well for several years, but did not always offer the students a uniform design experience as that depended on the particular instructor(s) teaching those classes in a given semester. As a result, the EET faculty came to the conclusion that in order to offer a more uniform experience to each cohort of students, it was best to offer a more traditional singular capstone design course taught by a single faculty member each semester. The focus of the new course is on addressing real-world problems and fostering the notion of entrepreneurship in the students. This would make the experience truly meaningful and more beneficial for the students in further preparing them for the real world of engineering. In this paper we examine some of the reasoning that went into the development of the new EET Senior Capstone Design Project course, as well as discuss some of the projects that were developed by the students during the first year of offering the new course.

It represents the centerpiece of the ECE curriculum's professional component and follows ABET guidelines as provided in its format. Without exception, all applied projects are team efforts. Teams must consist of between three (3) to five (5) members and the selection of a Team-Lead. Modern Lithium Battery systems require the use of a Battery Management System (BMS) to keep batteries in parallel connections, safe. These BMS sense Temperature T, Battery Voltage V, and State of Charge SoC for the user, then balances the cells to an equal voltage. Research and Development were conducted to modify the current standard of centralized BMS into a decentralized wireless D-BMS system to successfully meet industry requirement. In modern Electric Vehicle (EV) automotive applications, a BMS is a critical component in the design of modern battery systems. It usually requires the BMS to monitor Voltage, State of Charge (SOC), Temperature, charge, and discharge rates. Most BMS used today are centralized, which means all connections lead to a single location. This type of BMS has the advantage of being simple, inexpensive, and easy to source. However, with the race to create the most efficient electric vehicles, manufacturers are looking for new types of BMS Instrumentation topology termed 'Decentralized Battery Management System D-BMS'. These D-BMS cut wiring down by not stringing wires all throughout the battery system, saving weight, complexity, and reducing points of failure. In this project, this was achieved by breaking up the BMS into several separate 'child-units' created by Infineon-device monitoring, one module at a time. An ESP-32, a Low-cost, Low-Power system-on-a-chip L-PSoC microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth, was used to turn the ISO-UART co",

It has a positive impact on individual research programs, the university's researchenterprise and it is a critical factor for E&ET students in making a successful transition fromcollege to career. It also contributes to the intellectual life of individual departments and thecampus as a whole, while it raises the level of research activity, and helps recruit strongerundergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.The research, on which the present work is based, shows that research projects allow students toexplore, discover and innovate in a limited period of time and space. The literature reveals thatundergraduate research helps to integrate students with the faculty and industry, and so results inpublications which appear in peer-reviewed journals. Thus the student is able to create portfoliosthat highlight their learning and skills development in the professions. Through this training, keyquestions are explored and answered such as: How do we best incorporate research into theundergraduate curriculum? Does it make a difference? Who is it for? How do we know?

Though we have various renewable energy sources, the perfect one to use as an energy source for vehicles is hydrogen. Like electricity, hydrogen is an energy carrier that has the ability to deliver incredible amounts of energy. Onboard hydrogen storage in vehicles is an important factor that should be considered when designing fuel cell vehicles. In this study, a recent development in hydrogen fuel cell engines is reviewed to scrutinize the feasibility of using hydrogen as a major fuel in transportation systems. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that can produce electricity by allowing chemical gases and oxidants as reactants. With anodes and electrolytes, the fuel cell splits the cation and the anion in the reactant to produce electricity. Fuel cells use reactants, which are not harmful to the environment and produce water as a product of the chemical reaction. As hydrogen is one of the most efficient energy carriers, the fuel cell can produce direct current (DC) power to run the electric car. By integrating a hydrogen fuel cell with batteries and the control system with strategies, one can produce a sustainable hybrid car.",

          "abstract": "Offshore wind energy is a sustainable renewable energy source that is acquired by harnessing the force of the wind offshore, where the absence of obstructions allows the wind to travel at higher and more steady speeds. Offshore wind has recently grown in popularity because wind energy is more powerful offshore than on land. Prior to the development of floating structures, wind turbines could not be deployed in particularly deep or complicated seabed locations since they were dependent on fixed structures. With the advent of floating structures, which are moored to the seabed using flexible anchors, chains, or steel cables, wind turbines can now be placed far offshore. The deployment of floating wind turbines in deep waters is encouraged by several benefits, including steadier winds, less visual impact, and flexible acoustic noise requirements. A thorough understanding of the physics underlying the dynamic response of the floating offshore wind turbines, as well as various design principles and analysis methods, is necessary to fully compete with traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels. The present work offers a comprehensive review of the most recent state-of-the-art developments in the offshore wind turbine technology, including aerodynamics, hydromechanics, mooring, ice, and inertial loads. The existing design concepts and numerical models used to simulate the complex wind turbine dynamics are also presented, and their capabilities and limitations are discussed in detail.",

          "abstract": "Wind energy has experienced a continuous cost reduction in the last decades. A popular cost reduction technique is to increase the rated power of the wind turbine by making it larger. However, it is not clear whether further upscaling of the existing wind turbines beyond the 5–7 MW range is technically feasible and economically attractive. To address this question, this study uses 5, 10, and 20 MW wind turbines that are developed using multidisciplinary design optimization as upscaling data points. These wind turbines are upwind, 3-bladed, pitch-regulated, variable-speed machines with a tubular tower. Based on the design data and properties of these wind turbines, scaling trends such as loading, mass, and cost are developed. These trends are used to study the technical and economical aspects of upscaling and its impact on the design and cost. The results of this research show the technical feasibility of the …",

Aerodynamic interaction between the turbines causes sub-optimal energy production. A control strategy to mitigate these losses is by redirecting the wake by yaw misalignment. This paper aims to assess the influence of load variations of the rotor due to partial wake overlap and presents a combined optimization of the power and loads using wake redirection. For this purpose, we design a computational framework which computes the wind farm power production and the wind turbine rotor loads based on the yaw settings. The simulation results show that partial wake overlap can significantly increase asymmetric loading of the rotor disk and that yaw misalignment is beneficial in situations where the wake can be sufficiently directed away from the downstream turbine.",

          "abstract": "In order to make offshore wind power a cost effective solution that can compete with the traditional fossil energy sources, cost reductions on the expensive offshore support structures are required. One way to achieve this, is to reduce the uncertainty in wave load calculations by using a more advanced model for wave kinematics. As offshore wind turbines are generally sited in shallow water, nonlinear effects which results in steeper waves with higher velocities and accelerations are common. Whereas extreme waves are modeled with higher-order nonlinear regular wave models, fatigue loads are calculated from kinematics obtained by a lowfidelity linear irregular wave model. In this paper, a second-order wave model that is employed to simulate the dynamic response due to nonlinear irregular waves on a full set of IEC-standard load cases. This method is computationally efficient, which is particularly useful for design optimization studies. It is shown that by using this method for a 25 m deep site in the German Bight, equivalent fatigue loads increase by 7.5% compared to the traditional linear wave model. The effect of nonlinear waves on fatigue is most prevalent in the foundation and tower parts near the sea surface. Furthermore, it is found that the increase in fatigue damage accumulation is most prevalent in wind-wave misaligned load cases, in which aerodynamic damping is absent.",

To do any aeroelastic simulation, the structural properties of the blade such as stiffnesses and mass per unit length should be known in advance, and extracting these properties is a difficult task. This paper presents an analytical model to extract these structural properties in a simple way. It starts with calculating an equivalent material property of the cross section using weighting method. Then the centroid of each section is obtained. Next the second moment of inertia of each element relevant to its local coordinates system is calculated and transferred to the centroid of the section using parallel axis theorem. A coordinate transformation is employed to rotate these second moment of inertias around any arbitrary axis. Finally, flapwise and edgewise stiffnesses are found by multiplying the equivalent modulus of elasticity to the second area moment of inertia in each section. Mass per unit length is calculated by multiplying the equivalent density to the real area of each section. The method is verified with the structural properties of a commercial 660 kW wind turbine blade. Despite the simplicity of the method the results show a good agreement.",

To do that, the controller design is automated and integrated with an aeroelastic simulation tool. This integrated tool is linked with an optimization engine. The automated controller has two built-in control algorithms; a generator-torque controller and an above rated pitch-controller. This new tool is used in the DOP of the 5MW NREL research wind turbine. To show how this method works some parameters of both the generatortorque controller and the pitch-controller are introduced as design variables in the DOP. As the result of changing controller related design variables within each optimization iteration, the values of the objective function and the design constraint also change. This shows that by introducing the controller’s parameters as design variables in the DOP a more realistic assessment of the objective function and constraints is possible that helps the optimizer to search for better solutions.",

          "abstract": "Wind energy shows a great promise to be a major supplier of clean energy. However, to stay financially competitive with other sources of energy, its cost needs to be further reduced. Unlike the traditional energy resources that have good certainty in predicting the amount and cost of generated electricity, wind energy shows large uncertainties due to several uncertain input parameters. These uncertainties increase the financial investment risks, and thereby introduce higher interest rates that adds up to the cost. This study investigates the influence of the meteorological input parameters on the levelized cost of energy for a 20 MW research wind turbine. These uncertain input parameters are the wind shear, air density, average wind speed and Weibull shape parameter. Aeroservoelastic simulations are performed to evaluate the levelized cost of energy. C-type Gram Charlier series function is used to assess the probability density of levelized cost of energy. For computational efficiency, dimensional reduction technique is employed to compute the raw moments. The results of this study show that the average wind speed and air density have a high influence on the levelized cost of energy in terms of both the magnitude and occurrence of the probability density function. While the deterministic levelized cost of energy for the 20 MW wind turbine design is computed to be 3.45 USCents/kWHr, the probabilistic results of this research only consider 15.9% probability of occurrence for such a value, with a cumulative chance of 3.3% for the levelized cost of energy to be less than 3.45 USCents/kWHr due to uncertain input parameters.",

          "abstract": "The installation of floating wind farms in deeper water is encouraged by the stronger and steadier wind, the lower visibility and noise impact, the absence of road restrictions, but also the absence or shortage of shallow water. In the summer of 2009, the first large-scale floating wind turbine ”Hywind” was installed. Hywind is a spar-buoy concept with three catenary mooring lines. The experience with modeling floating turbines is still limited. Furthermore, existing models for the design of offshore wind turbines are highly complex as they focus - by definition - mostly on the forces of the wind on the turbine. The correctness and applicability of existing simulation models for the design of floating wind turbines can therefore not be assumed a-priori and need to be researched. This requires that the driving physical processes governing the behaviour of floating wind turbines are investigated first. For this purpose, a new basic model A.T.FLOW has been developed. The requirement of A.T.FLOW is that it incorporates the most significant physical processes so as to be able to provide insight into the dominant physical behaviour of spar-type floating wind turbines. Assumptions have been made that illustrate the limitations of A.T.FLOW. Various verification methods show that the model simulates load cases as expected and is a useful tool for assessing the physical behaviour of spar-type floating wind turbines. The coming two years the body forces and behaviour of the operating full-scale Hywind demo project is monitored. This data should be used to further test and validate A.T.FLOW and to guide further development of the model.",

It is engineered to overcome the limitations of traditional soft serial robot arms, which are typically low in structural stiffness and blocking force. Soft robotic systems are becoming increasingly popular due to their inherent compliance match to that of human body, making them an efficient solution for applications requiring direct contact with humans. The proposed soft robot consists of three soft closed-loop kinematic chains, each of which includes a soft actuator and a compliant four-bar arm. The complex nonlinear dynamics of the soft robot are numerically modeled, and the model is validated experimentally using a 6-DOF electromagnetic position sensor. This research contributes to the growing body of literature in the field of soft robotics, providing insights into the computational design, fabrication, and control of soft parallel robots for use in a variety of complex applications.",

Traditionally, rigid materials are used to design hand prosthesis covered by a soft layer of skin to mimic the appearance and look of a natural human hand. This process results in rigid, bulky and complex hand prostheses that are difficult to design, fabricate and operate by amputees. In this research, a pneumatically actuated soft robotic hand is designed and constructed with the intent to create a working prototype, which can be used as a prosthetic hand with individually actuating fingers. For the body of the robot, our design uses soft elastomers for the palm and fingers of the prosthesis. For actuation, we use a pneumatic driven actuator made of the same material as the body of the prosthesis. The power supply to this system is provided using a pressurized cylinder that uses five solenoid valves to actuate and control the fingers using an Arduino R2 microcontroller. Our preliminary results and the prototype show the functionality of the hand prosthesis with the incorporation of soft elastomers and flexible novel fluidic actuation. This technique provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between the hand and the environment, allowing the disabled person to achieve robust grasping and manipulation of objects.",

However, the stresses should remain the same for a suitable design. Application of linear scaling laws may lead to an upscaled blade that may not be any more a feasible design. In this paper a non-linear upscaling approach is presented with the aim of keeping the stresses in the upscaled blade the same as the reference blade. The stresses due to the weight, aerodynamics and centrifugal forces are taken into account and the blade is modeled as a beam with equivalent structural properties. This new methodology is used to upscale the 5 MW NREL wind turbine blade to a 20 MW wind turbine blade. As a result, a 20 MW wind turbine blade is obtained in which the stresses are the same as the 5 MW blade. This provides initial blade design solution for optimization studies that is feasible and enables the designer to explore other interesting aspects of larger scale wind turbines.",

          "abstract": "The Stewart platform, a parallel robot configuration, traditionally employs six rigid linear actuators to connect a base with a mobile platform. These actuators, typically prismatic and connected by spherical or universal joints, are arranged in alternating pairs, enabling six degrees of freedom in positioning and orientation. While this architecture has proven effective in applications requiring robust and rigid positioning systems, the advent of soft or compliant actuators presents new possibilities, especially in applications where safety is paramount, such as in medical robots involving human contact. This paper introduces a novel compliant Stewart mechanism, incorporating soft 3D-printed linear actuators designed to replace the rigid joints and legs in conventional rigid Stewart mechanisms. It explores the implementation of these soft actuators within the Stewart platform's framework, aiming to retain its six degrees of freedom (DOF) motion while enhancing safety and adaptability in sensitive environments. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of this approach, opening new avenues in robotic design for medical and other human-interactive applications where the combination of precision, safety, and adaptability is critical.",

Since energy storage systems (ESSs) are essential for the microgrids relying on renewable energies, it is assumed that the smart microgrid (SMG) is equipped with one main ESS. It is also assumed that several PEVs are connected to the grid via bidirectional controllable chargers, considering the proliferation of PEVs. In case of islanding, the proposed method controls the discharging rates of the PEVs to decrease the output power of the main ESS. This leads to an enhancement in the grid ride-through-ability, and consequently, its resiliency since the SMG can longer supply the loads in islanding mode. The proposed method is evaluated utilizing Matlab/Simulink. According to the simulation results, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed control system are presented and discussed.",

We present an analysis based on symmetry considerations and examine the impact on the scattering matrix for graphene systems containing defects that enhance spin-orbit interactions, while conserving the electronic total angular momentum. We show that the appearance and dominance of skew scattering, and the related observation of valley and/or spin Hall effect in decorated graphene samples, suggests the set of symmetries that adatom perturbations should satisfy. We further show that detailed measurements of the transport and elastic times as a function of carrier concentration make it possible to not only extract the strength of the spin-orbit interaction, as …",

Here we address the effects of the real incommensurability between lattices by implementing a continuum model approach that does not require small-period supercells. The approach allows us to study the role of possible relative twists of the layers, and verify that the SOC transfer is robust to twists, in agreement with observations.

Using Keldysh-Floquet Green's functions, we develop a theoretical framework to calculate the time-averaged RKKY coupling under weak periodic drives, and we show that its magnitude in undoped graphene can be decreased controllably by increasing the driving strength, while mostly maintaining its ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic character.

In the weak drive regime, the time-averaged screened potential exhibits unconventional Friedel oscillations with multiple spatial periods contributed by a principal period modulated by higher-order periods, which are due to the emergence of additional Kohn anomalies in the polarization function. In the strong drive regime, the time-averaged impurity potential becomes almost unscreened and does not exhibit Friedel oscillations. This tunable Friedel oscillations is a result of the dynamic gating effect of the time-dependent driving field on the two-dimensional electron system.",

We characterize the valley birefringence produced by a circularly symmetric Kekul\\'e patterned and gated region using the scattering approach. We found caustics with two cusps separated in space by a distance dependent on the Kekul\\'e interaction and that provides a measure of its strength. Then at low carrier concentration, we find a nonvanishing skew cross-section, showing the asymmetry in the scattering of electrons around the axis of the incoming flux. This effect is associated with the appearance of the valley Hall effect as electrons with opposite valley polarization are deflected toward opposite directions.",

The temperature- and angle-dependent torque magnetometry measurements revealed at least nine different frequencies ranging from $\\ensuremath{\\sim}10$ T up to $\\ensuremath{\\sim}9000$ T. These frequencies correspond to extremal areas of the Fermi surface ranging from $\\ensuremath{\\sim}0.2%$ up to 50% of the first Brillouin zone, qualitatively consistent with the electronic band structure calculations. The angle-dependent dHvA oscillation frequencies indicate that the smaller pockets of the Fermi surface have an almost three-dimensional character whereas the bigger pockets of the Fermi surface are mostly two dimensional. We also find evidence of the presence of light $[0.28(1)\\phantom{\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}{m}_{0}]$ as well as heavy $[2.37(18)\\phantom{\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}{m}_{0}]$ charge carriers through the analysis of the temperature dependence of dominant frequencies. The comparison of the observed frequencies with the electronic band structure calculations indicates that the heavy masses correspond to saddle-point-like features of electronic band structure at the $M$ point. The observation of the multiple low frequencies and the calculated contributions from various bands to such low frequencies prevent the estimation of the topological nature of bands containing lighter fermions. In conclusion, our work reveals the features of a Fermi surface containing enhanced mass fermions originating from saddle points in the electronic band structure at the $M$ point, which is inherent to kagome lattices.",

Despite particle–hole asymmetry in TIs, it has often been assumed that their surface states are characterized by a particle–hole symmetric Dirac energy dispersion. In this work, we demonstrate that the effect of particle–hole asymmetry is essential to correctly describe the energy spectrum and the magneto-optical response in TIs thin-films. In thin-films of TIs with a substantial degree of particle–hole symmetry breaking, such as Sb2Te3, the longitudinal optical conductivity displays absorption peaks arising from optical transitions between bulk and surface Landau levels for low photon energies. The transition energies between the bulk and surface Landau levels exhibit clearly discernable signatures from those between surface Landau levels due to their distinct magnetic field dependence. Bulk contributions to the magneto-optical conductivity in a TI thin-film are enhanced via one type of doping while being suppressed by the other. This asymmetric dependence on the type of doping aids in revealing the particle–hole asymmetry in TI thin-films.",

We present our analysis of light-driven effects on the interlayer exchange coupling mediated by a bulk Rashba semiconductor in a magnetic multilayer. The collinear magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the photon-dressed spin-orbit coupled electrons of BiTeI develops light-induced oscillation periods and displays new decay power laws, both of which are enhanced with an increasing light-matter coupling. For magnetic layers with non-collinear magnetization, we find a non-collinear magnetic exchange coupling uniquely generated by light-driving of the multilayer. As the non-collinear magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the photon-dressed electrons of BiTeI is unique to the irradiated system and it is enhanced with increasing light-matter coupling, this effect offers a promising platform of investigation of light-driven effects on magnetic phenomena in spin-orbit coupled systems. In this platform, light properties, such as its intensity, can serve as external knobs for inducing non-collinear couplings of the interlayer exchange and for modulating the collinear couplings. Both of these effects signify the photo-generated modification in the spin textures of spin-orbit coupled electrons in BiTeI.",

The FIS is also found to help recover from the infeasible design space rapidly. The effectiveness of the improved algorithm is demonstrated by solving a welded beam design problem and a two part stamping optimization problem.

Engineers on one hand are good critical thinkers but on the other often lack in communication and interpersonal skills. This lack of interpersonal and communication skills may be attributed to the lack of importance given to these disciplines during their engineering education. In this paper, we analyze the importance of humanities in engineering curriculum. Emphasis on liberal arts and humanities can prepare engineers to fulfill their cultural and civic responsibilities. For an engineering educator, it is vital to inculcate in the engineering students, the importance of studying humanities that can open up their minds to the use of creative ideas from great minds outside of science. Humanists claim that the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge techniques that engineers learn in their college curriculum have a limited shelf life. If they master the humanities, it can provide tools for extending that shelf life. One of the most important aspects of engineering is effective communication, both verbal and written. Humanities study can strengthen the ability of engineers to work and communicate with others.",

Some specific research has been devoted to augment the convergence and related behavior of annealing algorithms by modifying its parameters, otherwise known as cooling schedule. Here we introduce an approach to tune the simulated annealing algorithm by combining algorithmic and parametric augmentations.

However, current literature does not provide clear conclusions whether enforcing an attendance policy actually improves student performance. This study explores student and faculty perceptions regarding the utility of attendance policies in undergraduate courses at a polytechnic university. Anonymous surveys were completed by 89 faculty members and 455 responses from five schools (Engineering, Engineering Technology and Management, Computer and Software Engineering, Architecture, and Arts and Sciences) on a single campus. Comparisons between theperceptions of students and faculty members are presented, as are comparisons between theperceptions of lower-level and upper-level students. Variations in perceptions based on major arealso highlighted. Finally, trends in perceptions regarding attendance policies in lower-level versus upper-level undergraduate courses are revealed. Students, regardless of major, class standing, or course level, reported attending more classes in courses that had attendance policies. The most significant impact of an attendance policy on class attendance was observed at the freshman level. While 84% of freshmen reported attending at least 90% of the classes in a course with an attendance policy, only 67% reported attending at that rate in a course without one. Qualitative data containing student and faculty attitudes towards attendance policies are also analyzed and discussed. Even though class attendance appeared to have …",

However laboratories may not include a hydrostatic device, assuming it is so straight forward that it does not warrant a laboratory instrument or a laboratory exercise. As part of the senior design class a group of students wanted to design and build a Fluid Statics device that will clearly verify the static force and buoyancy theories of fluids. An idea from the Internet was used to design such a device. It was then built and tested for measuring fluid static force and buoyancy. The device worked pretty satisfactorily and the authors decided to include it as a regular laboratory experiment in the Fluid Mechanics course. The students were able to use the device easily to verify the hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy theories within a respectable margin of error. Student learning and satisfaction were measured by specifically designed survey instruments which indicate good comprehension of the topics. Some dissatisfaction with the accuracy and repeatability of measurements were indicated by the students. These would be the target for improvement in the next version of the apparatus. This paper describes the design and operation of the device as well as teaching modules and user surveys to match the results with laboratory outcomes. Such an inexpensive but functional apparatus can enhance a traditional undergraduate fluids laboratory. Student learning was positive after using it for a laboratory exercise. Included drawings and teaching modules may benefit other faculty members who want to take advantage of the current design.",

Many students find undergraduate research as a tryout for potential graduate studies, as well as a way to establish relationship with research faculty. Albeit new in our Mechanical Engineering Technology department, two students were selected to participate in a research involving defects in composite materials. These students did have minimal background in composites from the general Engineering Materials course. These minority students were supported by summer scholarships from Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP). The issue of defects and their effect on the mechanical properties of composites is of great concern among high end users. A limited set of experimental investigation with defective composite flat panels was selected for investigation. One of our adjunct faculty offered access to his fabrication facility and guidance to the students for fabricating these ‘defective’panels. Three types of defects were incorporated: hole as a discontinuity, edge groove simulating transverse crack, and Teflon interlayer simulating delamination. Once the panels were fabricated, strips were cut out for testing. Students also learned special processes for cutting and drilling composites. Aluminum tabs ware glued to the ends of the composite strips to facilitate gripping by tensile tester. Two main testing methods were employed: tensile and 3-point bending. Unique failure modes of these specimens provided a lot of excitement as well as exposure regarding the mechanical …",

While over 5.6 million such commercial trailer trucks are registered in the country and with increasing diesel fuel prices, it is more important than ever to study their aerodynamics, redesign for reducing aerodynamic drag and help make these ‘big rigs’ more fuel efficient. Aerodynamic drag is the force that acts on a solid object moving in air due to difference in dynamic pressure developed around that object. Skin friction also causes resistance force which is small compared to pressure induced drag. Higher drag resistance, just like road and tire resistance, causes loss of energy and thereby lowers fuel mileage. Drag resistance is …",

In this respect, the major challenges we envision are 1) to achieve occupancy monitoring in a minimally intrusive way, e.g., using the existing infrastructure in the buildings and not requiring installation of any apps in the users' smart devices, and 2) to develop effective data fusion techniques for improving occupancy monitoring accuracy using a multitude of sources.

In this study, we design a deep convolutional neural network architecture for categorizing hurricanes based on intensity using graphics processing unit.

Focal stacking is a technique of creating a single focused image from a stack of images collected with different depths of field.

To reduce the high bandwidth requirement of video streaming, videos are compressed by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancy, thus yielding dependencies among frames as well as within a frame. Unnecessary transmission and maintenance of useless packets in the buffers cause further loss and degrade the quality of delivery (QoD) significantly. In this paper, we propose a QoD‐aware hop system that can decide when and which packets could be dropped without degrading QoD. Moreover, the transmission of useless packets causes network congestion and vain payment by the wireless system subscriber.

They are widely used in wireless packet-switching networks and mobile communications. The major difference of multimedia networks from traditional networks is the deadline to display or (play) the arriving packets. Especially, this is more obvious in realtime video streaming applications. Real-time video streaming applications prefer User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for video packet transfers. The operation of sequential decoding in this paper is applied on wireless multimedia networks. Buffers are usually required by the sequential decoder to store packets if there is an empty space. Geometric/Pareto/1/N queue model is used to describe the behavior of the sequential decoders with finite buffers. In this paper, we present an analytical study on the finite buffer behaviors of the sequential decoding system and provide closed form expression for the blocking probability due to limited buffer capacity, system throughput, and average buffer occupancy. We present also a simulation study to show the average buffer occupancy.",

In this study, we propose a generic framework for image thresholding that utilizes a tree based structure to determine the best thresholding approach for a particular case. We call our method “DT-Binarize,” and apply our method to the protein crystallization image dataset. In our experiments, we compare the results with the reference binary images that are manually generated by our research group. In order to provide more reliable and objective comparison, numerical results are presented as well as the visual results. Experimental results indicate that the correctness of DT-Binarize …",

          "abstract": "The most important components of multimedia networking are video streaming and synchronization. In video networking, the frames are split into smaller packets at the application layer. The packets of a frame are assembled before being processed at the receiver. For realtime video streaming, packet acknowledgments and retransmission are not practical. When congestion occurs, some packets may be dropped. Consequently, the entire frame (and sometimes successive frames in a group) is considered lost (ie, not displayable). Often a loss of one packet from the frame can lead to a loss of the whole frame. Selective Message Discarding Policies have been proposed to reduce or avoid congestion and achieve a better buffer utilization by discarding all packets that do not belong to good messages. In this paper, these discarding policies are studied and applied for MPEG video data transmission. Our queuing …",

This makes it necessary to employ novel methods to retain and prove the integrity of captured scene in criminal investigations. In this vein, blockchain technology has received a substantial interest in the last decade as it provides trust among users without a trusted third party, which enabled a myriad of applications. To this end, we propose a framework that utilizes blockchain technology to verify integrity of a camera footage recorded by a resource‐constrained wireless Internet of Things (IoT) device. The proposed approach computes the hash of the video data before it leaves the IoT device to ensure the integrity. The hash is then stored on a permissioned blockchain platform that enables detection of tampering in the video. The continuous stream is segmented efficiently to have …",

One of the major issues about determining these factors is that screening is often expanded to many hundreds or thousands of conditions to maximize combinatorial chemical space coverage for maximizing the chances of a successful (crystalline) outcome. In this paper, we propose an experimental design method called “Associative Experimental Design $(AED)$” and an optimization method includes eliminating prohibited combinations and prioritizing reagents based on $AED$ analysis of results from protein crystallization experiments. $AED$ generates candidate cocktails based on these initial screening results. These results are analyzed to determine those screening factors in chemical space that are most likely to lead to higher scoring outcomes, crystals. We have …",

Although redundancy may increase the reliability at a level, uncontrolled redundancy aggravates the retrieval performance and might be useless if the returned documents are obsolete. Document similarity matching algorithms do not provide the information on the differences of documents, and file synchronization algorithms are usually inefficient and ignore the structural and syntactic organization of documents.

The usage of PRNU in distinguishing cameras across different manufacturers and models has proven to be successful; however, we demonstrate that current approaches fail to distinguish cameras amongst the same manufacturers and models. As such, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm that focuses on emphasizing the pixels that contribute to the sensor noise in the PRNU pattern to distinguish cameras of the same type.

In order to deal with the forensic implications of social networks, current research on both digital forensics and social networks need to be incorporated and understood. This will help digital forensics investigators to predict, detect and even prevent any criminal activities in different forms. It will also help researchers to develop new models/techniques in the future. This paper provides literature review of the social network forensics methods, models, and techniques in order to provide an overview to the researchers for their future works as well as the law enforcement investigators for their investigations when crimes are committed in the cyber space.

The question of constructing optimal approximating spline for each function proved to be very hard. In fact, no polynomial time algorithm of adaptive spline approximation can be designed and no exact formula for the optimal error of approximation can be given. Therefore, the next natural question would be to study the asymptotic behavior of the error and construct asymptotically optimal sequences of partitions.

The first results on exact inequalities of the type (1) were obtained by Landau [3] for q= p= s=∞, k= 1, and r= 2. A survey of subsequent results on exact inequalities of the types (1) and (2) can be found in [4].

The value of the unit price bid is one of the leading indicators to comprehensively reflect the cost to the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) for these projects. Compared with other cost index research, the changing trend and large volatility of unit price bids make the prediction more difficult. This research proposes a robust ensemble learning model to predict the value of unit price bids. Data on bidding prices for more than 1,400 projects in the past nine years, along with 57 related variables, are collected, and 20 of them are selected by Boruta feature analysis to train and test the model. The results are compared with those from a baseline Monte Carlo simulation and a multiple linear regression model. Comparison shows that the proposed ensemble learning …",

This is a critical problem for state highway agencies that strive to develop more accurate cost estimates, deliver projects within the budget, and optimize constrained funds for their highway programs. This inaccuracy problem is a temporal issue since the engineer’s estimate is developed ahead of time before the project is advertised and bids are received. The question that transportation agencies are interested in finding an answer to is: are there any significant risk factors in the construction market indicating to the increased likelihood of the deviation between owner’s estimate and the submitted low bid?

However, few empirical studies are focused on analyzing the low bid deviation. Thus, the objective of this research is to identify factors affecting the low bid deviation from the agency’s engineer’s estimate. To achieve this objective, this study uses several important variables with the potential to explain the deviation, for example, variables representing project characteristics and market condition factors. Historical cost information for highway construction projects let in the State of Louisiana between 2011 and 2015 are utilized to build the explanatory model. Logit regression analysis is conducted for measuring the effects of influential factors on the low bid deviation. The results of this study indicate that the competition of bidding process, the number of activities in the contract, crude oil price, and value of construction put in place of pavement projects have significant impacts on the low bid deviation. This study contributes to the body of knowledge through the creation of a logit regression model that provides valuable insights into significant factors impacting the low bid deviation. It is anticipated that transportation professionals benefit from the findings of this research to develop more accurate bids and making reliable investment decisions for highway projects.",

The study applies geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to explore spatial variations of relationships between submitted unit price bids and explanatory variables and to create a set of local models with the capability to describe variations in submitted unit price bids. The regression analysis of submitted unit prices for asphalt line items, drawn from in highway pavement projects in the state of Georgia between 2008 and 2015, examines key variables, including the quantity of the bid item, the total contract price, the number of bids, the dollar value of a project, and the price index of asphalt cement. The results indicate significant spatial variation in the relationship between submitted unit price bid and the identified explanatory variables. Not only is GWR analysis capable of more accurately describing variation in submitted unit price bids, but it also provides a means of exploring the geographical variation of construction costs in a graphical manner.",

As market conditions are volatile and less predictive, public highway agencies encounter a difficulty in obtaining the certain number of bidders for their projects. It is argued in the literature that the degree of competition for highway construction projects might be influenced by several factors, such as project types, geographic locations of projects, prices of resources, and construction volume. However, there has not been a comprehensive empirical study to explore the relationship between the number of bidders on highway projects and construction and economic market conditions. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of the construction market and economic conditions on the degree of competition for highway projects.

          "abstract": "Price volatility in wages, materials, and equipment has a significant impact on highway construction costs. As the construction market and economy have experienced dynamic changes in prices, the price volatility becomes less predictable. In addition, various levels of the price volatility in different market locations aggravate the prediction. Thus, in developing highway construction costs, transportation agencies should consider geographical location of construction projects and market conditions of the locations. Transportation agencies face significant uncertainties in price volatility across different geographical locations. This volatility may not be uniformly distributed across different geographical locations due to changes in the availability of local contractors, materials, equipment, and labor. The objective of this research is to develop statistical models that are capable to explain spatial variations in submitted unit prices for asphalt line items in highway projects considering local market condition factors. Historical bid data used in this research consist of resurfacing and widening projects let in the state of Georgia, the United States, between 2008 and 2015. The methodology of this research is a spatial regression analysis to explain the spatial variation in the submitted unit prices for asphalt line items. The findings of this research indicate that volatility in submitted bid prices is not uniformly distributed across different geographical locations within the same transportation agency. The contribution to the body of knowledge of this research is an improved understanding of the role of local construction market and macroeconomic conditions to explain …",

To estimate prices for LS pay items, cost estimators and designers in state DOTs apply engineering judgment using knowledge from similar projects from the past and reach out to subject matter experts for providing additional resources. However, researching similar projects for finding appropriate estimates for the LS pay item is not a simple endeavor and leads to significant inaccuracy of cost estimates. A need exists to develop new methods that are capable of capturing key information from project documents and incorporating the complex nonlinear relationships between input and output variables in developing prediction models for LS pay item prices for highway projects. Thus, the overarching objective of this research is to develop forecasting models to estimate the prices of the Traffic Control and Grading Complete LS pay items using advanced text mining and machine learning algorithms that detect key patterns of information generated during project development and provide higher accuracy in cost estimates. In this research, a forecasting model for the prices of the Traffic Control and Grading Complete LS pay items was developed using machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest, bagging, k-nearest neighbors, and stacking regressor).

Moreover, for the contractors, it helps to establish investing and pricing strategies, such as the decision for participating in a bid and adjusting the mark-up (profit) level for the bid. Thus, this paper aims to identify the leading indicators of the level of competition for transportation projects and create multivariate time series models for forecasting the level of competition. The study uses the monthly level of competition of highway projects let in the state of Georgia between 2010 and 2018. Ten potential leading indicators of the level of competition, representing the local highway construction market, the construction market, the energy market, and macroeconomic market conditions, were used in this study. This study found the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Georgia construction industry and the number of hires as the leading indicators of the level of competition through the Granger causality test. Vector Error Correction (VEC) models were then developed for forecasting the level of competition with the identified leading indicators. The predictability of the developed VEC model for the level of competition represents a useful tool for making decisions in letting, investing, and pricing the transportation project.",

Since LS pay items are mainly unitless and do not have a consistent relationship with their quantities, it imposes a critical burden on estimating accurate prices of LS pay items for highway projects. State highway agencies (SHAs) often encounter significant variations in prices of LS pay items throughout the project development process. Inaccuracies of prices of LS pay items can cause significant cost escalation, project delay, and scope change. However, the current literature indicates that few studies have focused on exploring factors affecting the prices of LS pay items for highway projects. Thus, the overarching objective of this study is to identify and analyze factors affecting the prices of LS pay items used for highway projects. This study analyzed Traffic Control Lump Sum (TCLS) and Grading Complete Lump Sum (GCLS) pay items collected in the state of Georgia, using statistical analysis. This study identified the relationships between the prices of the LS pay items and important project-related factors, such as construction cost, estimated contract time, and major projects. The findings of this study help SHAs estimate more accurate prices of LS pay items and develop more accurate construction costs for highway projects.",

Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes 2,915 historical transportation project bids from Louisiana (2012–2024). The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. A two-stage feature selection process was implemented, combining Pearson correlation filtering and mutual information ranking to select the top nine predictive variables. Five ML models, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, TabNet, and a stacking ensemble, were trained and evaluated. Model interpretability was enhanced through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and sensitivity analysis. Findings TabNet achieved the best predictive performance, capturing complex, nonlinear relationships among variables. SHAP analysis revealed that the number of bidders, construction investment levels, and material costs were the most influential factors. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the measurable impact of construction demand and input prices on predicted deviations, while employment-related variables showed lower marginal influence. Research limitations/implications This study is limited by its reliance on historical bid data from a single U.S. state (Louisiana), which may constrain the generalizability of the findings to other regions with different procurement frameworks, contractor behaviors, and economic dynamics. Furthermore, while the selected ML models demonstrated strong predictive performance under typical market conditions, their effectiveness may decrease during periods of economic volatility or unexpected disruption. These limitations highlight the need for future research to incorporate multi-state datasets, consider temporal modeling strategies, and explore regional heterogeneity in contractor markets and procurement practices.

However, there is a lack of studies that studied the project management organizational structure of state DOTs in terms of the relative position of the dedicated PMU with other functional offices and the authority level of project managers (PMs). Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the state DOTs’ project management organizational structures and recommended practices of organizational structures for project management. This paper conducted, a survey, an extensive content analysis, and interviews with PMs and SMEs in state DOTs. The primary contribution of this study to the overall body of knowledge is the insights of state DOTs’ organizational structures by conceptualizing the relationships among the PMU and functional offices within the organization and identifying the state of practices in project management organizational structures.",

It is unknown what influence, if any, Islamic beliefs have on the conceptions of mental illness expressed by Muslim Americans. This study explores the conceptions of Muslim Americans regarding mental illness. Two hundred and fifty-five individuals identifying as Muslim American participated in a mixed-method anonymous survey. The results of the survey reveal that most Muslim American participants adhere primarily to the dominant Western biomedical model of mental illness, but open-ended responses reflect a more complex understanding of mental illness as having biological, environmental, and psycho-spiritual origins. Findings suggest that how a Muslim American interprets mental illness will most likely depend upon the symptoms and context of the illness. Further exploration is needed to understand the beliefs of Muslim Americans and the way in which these beliefs affect attitudes toward therapies and mental health services.",

The purpose of this study was to examine acculturation in a sample of both American-born and Immigrant Muslim Americans. Two hundred and fifty five Muslim Americans completed a scale designed to assess two aspects of acculturation within the population: adherence to Islamic identity and conformity to American social norms. The survey was distributed in both a paper-based and online anonymous format consisting of demographic questions and the acculturation scale designed for this study. Results revealed that both immigrants and U.S. born Muslim Americans demonstrate a strong adherence to their Islamic identity and low levels of conformity to American social norms. American-born Muslims scored significantly lower on conformity to American social norms than immigrant Muslims. Study findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that Muslim Americans are less likely to sacrifice religious values to assimilate. Specific item results provide insight into what aspects of American culture Muslims are more willing to adopt, and which they are likely to shun. These findings demonstrate the challenges Muslim Americans face integrating in an increasingly hostile host culture.",

The second strongest correlate was participants’ perceived severity of COVID-19 across the United States. Perceived effectiveness of recommended practices accounted for the largest variance in behavioral intention. However, analysis of individual behaviors indicated a mismatch in the behaviors perceived to be the most effective (avoiding sick people and mask-wearing) and those participants indicated intention to engage in (throwing away used tissues, avoiding sick people, and coughing into their elbows) in the next 30 days.\nConclusions: The authors recommend tailoring public health messaging to address the perceived threat of COVID-19 and …",

The high genetic variability of HBV and HCV genome is reflected by eight genotypes (A to H) and six genotypes (1 to 6), respectively. Each genotype has a characteristic geographical distribution, which is important epidemiologically. Previous studies from the province of Sindh, Pakistan have reported that genotypes D and A as well as D and B are prevalent HBV genotypes, and for HCV genotypes 3a and 3b to be dominant. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of co-infection of both HBV and HCV genotypes in physically healthy females at two universities in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan and HBV diagnosed patients41, 42, 56-59.\nMethodology: Blood was collected from a total of 4000 healthy female volunteer students and 28 HBV diagnosed patients. Serum samples obtained were screened for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBs antibodies and anti-HCV antibodies by immunochromatography and ELISA. Genotyping was carried out for 6 HBV genotypes (A through F) and 6 HCV genotypes (1 through 6). Genotyping data of HBV and HCV positive individuals are described.\nResults: Out of 4028 volunteers, 172 (4.3%) tested positive for HBsAg. All 172 serum samples were genotyped by PCR for both HBV and HCV.

Methods: A survey consisting of demographic questions and the Updated Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA) was distributed using an anonymous paper questionnaire to students on campus.\nResults\nAnalysis of the scale indicate a moderate to high rejection of rape myths regardless of gender, with the highest acceptance in both genders of the “She Lied” subscale. Both male and female students were likely to agree that a girl would lie about being raped to get even with a guy or after a sexual encounter that she regretted.

We begin the chapter by providing an overview of the sacred texts from several major world religions, with a focus on Christianity, Islam, and Judaism because these are religions that we are more familiar with.

Some individuals are asymptomatic while others develop complications within a few days after infection that can lead to fatalities in a smaller portion of the population. In the present study, we have analyzed the factors that may influence the outcome of post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. One factor that may influence virus control is pre-existing immunity conferred by an individual's past exposures to endemic coronaviruses (eCOVIDs) which cause the common cold in humans and generally, most children are exposed to one of the four eCOVIDs before 2 years of age. Here, we have carried out protein sequence analyses to show the amino acid homologies between the four eCOVIDs (i.e. OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63) as well as examining the cross-reactive immune responses between SARS-CoV-2 and eCOVIDs by epidemiologic analyses. Our results show that the nations where continuous exposures to eCOVIDs are very high due to religious and traditional causes showed significantly lower cases and low mortality rates per 100,000. We hypothesize that in the areas of the globe where Muslims are in majority and due to religious practices are regularly exposed to eCOVIDs they show a significantly lower infection, as well as mortality rate, and that is due to pre-existing cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This is due to cross-reactive antibodies and T-cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We also have reviewed the current literature that has also proposed that human infections with eCOVIDs impart protection against disease caused by subsequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that a nasal spray vaccine consisting of selected genes of eCOVIDs would be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.",

They provide a large body of scientific data carried out in their laboratory, utilizing developing human neurons exposed to femtomolar concentrations of chemicals found in fragrances. The studies demonstrate that synthetic fragrances can impart profound neuromodifications at the morphologic, immunologic, and molecular levels.

Saliva is one of the most accessible and non-invasive bodily fluids and exosomal miRNAs in saliva could be useful in (1) measuring stress states and (2) distinguishing between individuals suffering from high levels of chronic stress vs. adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that act as gene regulators. Several studies have shown differential expressions of certain miRNA in neurological diseases and in stress, post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) and anxiety. Detailed analyses of miRNA expressions and profiling of miRNAs among populations with various exposures to traumatic and life stressors have not been carried out. The goal of our study was to discover miRNAs associated with high chronic stress or childhood trauma. Method This study sought to explore miRNA expression in African American young women from a small, southern Historically Black College and University (HBCU). Twelve participants completed the social readjustment rating scale (SRRS), ACEs scale, and saliva collection and were divided into three groups based on ACE and chronic stress score: Low Chronic Stress (LCS; n = 4); High Chronic Stress (HCS; n = 4); High Chronic Stress + High ACEs (HCS+HA; n=4). A custom-made miRNA Taqman-Array tested for fold change in four miRNAs (i.e., miR-19b, miR-187, miR-34a and miR-135-3p ). Results There was a significant downregulation of miR-19b ( χ 2 (2, N=12) = 7.42, p &amp;lt; 0.01, η²= 0.915), miR-187 ( χ 2 (2, N = 12) = 7.36, p &amp;lt; 0.05, η²= 0.598), and miR-34a ( χ 2 (2, N = 12) = 7.42, p &amp;lt; 0.05, η²= 0.60). in both the HCS and the HCS+HA groups vs. LCS. Interestingly, miR-135-3p ( χ 2 (2, N = 12) = 8.00, p &amp;lt; 0.05, η²= 0.67. was upregulated in the HCS group vs. LCS and HCS+LA. Expression for miR-135-3p was not significantly different between LCS + HCS+HA. Conclusion Our analyses shows",

In particular, the study focuses on terrorism in Middle Eastern and North African (MENAP) countries and features terrorism incident count data for the period 1998–2012 using negative binomial regression models. In our exogenous model, we find that while youth unemployment tends to increase domestic terrorism, it does not have any significant effect on transnational terrorism. Given concerns about endogeneity of youth unemployment in these models, we use two kinds of corrections-instrumental variables and lagged variables. We control for endogeneity by using military expenditure, under-five mortality rate and foreign direct investment as instruments. We are not able to reject the null hypothesis that youth unemployment is exogenous. Using lagged …",

We determine the optimal allocation of resources between these two strategies wherein we model the role of intelligence using the concept of supermodular precision. One striking result is that under certain circumstances, an increase in the investment in intelligence can induce a more devious terrorist to attack with a higher probability.

The government assists the infrastructural firm by providing intelligence inputs about an impending attack. We find that subject to some conditions, expenditure on intelligence adds value only when its amount exceeds a threshold level. Also, the nature of the equilibrium depends on the level of government expenditure in intelligence.

Two kinds of equilibria are possible. In one, a non-deviant’s probability of being employed increases as expected market conditions improve which lowers the incentive to be a deviant. In contrast, in the other kind of equilibrium, the deviant’s probability of being employed increases when market conditions improve which increases the incentive to be a deviant.

          "abstract": "In this paper, we look at the interaction of terrorism with immigrants’ quality of life (measured by the foreign-born unemployment rate and globalization level) for OECD countries, and its impact on GDP per capita. We find strong evidence that GDP per capita is adversely affected by domestic terrorism. The magnitude of this effect is also substantial: at the sample mean, a one-standard-deviation increase in the number of domestic incidents is found to decrease GDP per capita between 5.7 % and 7.8 % of the sample average depending on the specification used. These results contrast with previous research which finds that transnational terrorism primarily affects these economic indicators. We find strong evidence that when we factor in the interaction of the foreign-born unemployment rate with either type of terrorism, an increase in the foreign-born unemployment rate decreases GDP per capita. On the policy front, we …",

One of the major criticisms of these laws is that it may hinder competition in the health care market, which can lead to higher prices. However, from a theoretical standpoint, CON laws could also promote competition by limiting excessive expansion from incumbents. Our main conclusion is that CON laws by and large enhanced competition in the inpatient market during the period of our study. This indicates that the effects of CON laws to hinder predatory behavior could dominate its effects of preventing new entrants into the inpatient care market. We do not find statistically significant evidence to reject the exogeneity assumption of either CON laws or their stringency in our study. We also find factors such as proportion of population aged 18–44, proportion of Asian American population, obesity rate, political …",

Sponsors are leaders that provide resources for combatants to fight each other. Sponsors 1 and 2 have strong aversion to sponsor 3’s proxy, but not against each other. Three pure strategy equilibria exist in the game. When the ex post value of winning is small, all players fight in equilibrium. However, when the ex post value of winning is large, in equilibrium either sponsors 1 and 2 coordinate their actions, with one of them staying out of the contest, or sponsor 3 does not participate. The probability of winning and the sponsors’ payoffs depend on a spillover effect. We find that no unique way of characterizing the comparative statics of the spillover effect emerges and that the answer varies from one equilibrium to another.

We consider each of these cases and determine the optimal human rights standard of the government. We then examine the effect of a decrease in the human rights standard on the probability of quelling the rebellion. In our theoretical model, this effect is indeterminate (i.e. can be positive or negative). We empirically quantify this effect using the case of Armed Forces Special Powers Act in India.

          "abstract": "Take the fort, then take the city. In a two-stage, two-party contest, victory in the initial stage can provide an advantage in the final stage. We examine such momentum in conflict scenarios and investigate how valuable it must be to avoid a Pyrrhic victory. Our main finding is that although the elasticity of effort—which we allow to vary between the two stages—does impact the contestants’ effort levels, it has no bearing on the endogenously determined value of momentum itself. Further, rent dissipation in the two-stage conflict is equal across party whether or not an individual obtains first-stage momentum. Thus, momentum helps a player solely by enhancing marginal ability for victory in the second-stage contest. It does not, however, change the player’s net calculus of secondstage contest spending. Such contestable advantage is also found to be more rent-dissipative than innate/uncontestable advantage. Therefore, Pyrrhic victories should be more common for contests with an intermediate stage or stages in which advantages can be earned, ceteris paribus. While intermediate targets appear as useful conflict benchmarks, they dissipate additional expected contest rents. This additional rent-dissipative toll exists even for backward-inductive equilibrium behavior in a complete information setting. Whereas the quagmire theory suggests parties can become involved in problematic conflicts due to incomplete information, the present paper finds that the setting of conflict—namely, contestable intermediate advantage—can alternatively generate rent-dissipative tolls. Similarly, contestable advantage can lead parties to optimally forego contest participation …",

          "abstract": "Over the last half the 20th Century, reproductive medicine has become a critically important branch of modern medical science. Fertility preservation is a vital branch of reproductive medicine and involves the preservation of gametes (sperm and oocytes), embryos, and reproductive tissues (ovarian and testicular tissues) for use in artificial reproduction. This technology gives millions of people suffering from reproductive ailments, cancer patients who have their reproductive functions destroyed by therapy (chemotherapy and radiation) and people undergoing sterilization, a chance to conceive. The most common fertility preservation technique is cryopreservation, which involves freezing cells and tissues at cryogenic temperatures. Cryopreserved cells and tissues can endure storage for centuries with almost no change in functionality or genetic information, making this storage method highly attractive. However, developing efficient cryopreservation techniques is challenging, as both freezing and thawing exposes cells to severe stresses, potentially causing cell death. There are two major techniques for cryopreservation: freeze-thaw processes and vitrification. The major difference between them is the total avoidance of ice formation in vitrification. The use of both theoretical models that describe cell response to freezing and thawing, and experimental investigations of freezing behavior, has led to the development of successful freeze-thaw and vitrification procedures for a number of cell types. Among reproductive cells, there exist efficient cryopreservation techniques for spermatozoa and embryos. Oocytes, however, present significant hurdles in achieving successful cryopreservation, primarily due to their sensitive microtubule structure. Recently, cryopreservation of ovarian and testicular tissues has been investigated with success reported. Ovarian cryopreservation can help circumvent many of the problems associated with oocyte cryopreservation, while testicular t",

As availability of synovial fluid is limited, this study aimed to evaluate in the peripheral blood of patients with RA, the relationship if any, between the extent of oxidative stress in terms of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils, plasma NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase activity with markers of oxidative damage, circulating cytokines and disease activity score (DAS28). In patients with RA, neutrophils in peripheral blood demonstrated an enhanced generation of ROS, coupled with depletion of free radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, the NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase activity was enhanced as were markers of damage. There was a positive correlation between the DAS 28 and generation of ROS, NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase activity as also with oxidative stress mediated protein carbonylation. Patients with RA demonstrated an increase in proinflammatory (IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ) and some anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-5, and TGF-β) cytokines. Although the levels of IL-17 correlated positively with generation of ROS, myeloperoxidase, markers of protein damage and DAS28, IL-23 correlated positively only with protein damage, and negatively with free radical scavenging activity. Importantly, incubation of neutrophils from healthy donors with plasma or SF from patients with RA translated into an enhanced generation of ROS, along with an elevation of intracellular proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together, in patients with RA, circulating neutrophils mediated a shift in the oxidant/antioxidant balance favouring the former, which translated into protein damage and contributed towards disease progression.",

It is also involved with cardio-vascular risk factors due to accelerated atherosclerosis. Oxidative burst, systemic inflammation coupled with endothelial dysfunction (ED), resulting in reduced bioavailability of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) and an increased number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) may correlate with disease activity and its sustenance. Hence, the study was aimed to detect and quantify CECs and assess the oxidative stress and inflammatory status in AS patients <i>vis-à-vis</i> healthy controls, as well as relate these parameters with AS disease activity and atherosclerotic markers in patients. Our study showed an increased frequency of endothelial cells in peripheral blood of AS patients in pro-inflammatory conditions. In AS patient population, they showed significant reduction of flow-mediated dilatation (%FMD) (<i>p</i> p p p p p -/CD31<sup>+</sup>/CD105<sup>+</sup>/CD144<sup>+</sup>) in patients compared to healthy controls positively correlated with disease activity and duration as well as with markers of oxidative stress. Thus, chronic inflammation and oxidative burst induce loss of NO bioavailability, leading to ED. This may cause the derangement of CECs that may be considered as a prognostic biomarker for ED.",

There has been less emphasis on scholarly composing with comics (some notable exceptions include Scott Mc-Cloud s celebrated Understanding Comics and Nick Sousanis's recently pub-lished dissertation, Unflattening). If youll excuse the irony of writing on such a topic in an alphabetic format, I suggest that fusions between comics and scholarship can (1) fruitfully challenge definitions of scholarly genres,(2) offer resources for designing arguments in digital environments, and (3) invite all who practice scholarly composing to reflect critically upon their mediating decisions.\nMessy Genres In …",

The series has connections to many different genres and narrative traditions within the realm of folkloristics. However, the folkloric genre most relevant to the ethos and aesthetics of Madoka is that of the fairy tale. Drawing on Bill Ellis’s concept of “fairy-telling” and scholarship on new media composition, in this paper we seek to investigate labyrinths as acts of embodied composing—not lairs of evil or destruction but rather creative material memory work that negotiates grief and despair. Many of the series’ action sequences unfold in “labyrinths,” the magical spaces controlled by witches. By composing a labyrinth, witches can simultaneously reshape their environment and create a powerful statement about identity through personalized performance in narrative spaces that they control. In particular, we argue that both the frameworks of “fairy tale” and “new media” give us useful analytical resources for beginning to make sense of the intricately complex phenomenon of Madoka’s labyrinths.",

Because of its design structure, the Pathways Project can be a challenging work to engage without sufficient framing, which Foley acknowledges in the project’s preface. This design draws attention to the conventions of print reading (otherwise frequently taken for granted) by stretching these conventions to their limits and contrasting them with the networked information structures afforded by oral and digital communication environments.

E-lit regularly confronts theoretical, cultural, and material challenges endemic to the field, as genres of previously accessible work are being lost to technological obsolescence and new developments are moving increasingly off the screen and out of practical reach. One way to counter such challenges of these\"(un) continuous\" times is through an integrated, applied, practice-based model of e-lit pedagogy. Participants discuss ways of teaching electronic literature that incorporates hands-on work like critical-creative making and procedural performance as pedagogical responses to rapid technological changes that blot out e-literature’s past and blackbox its future.",

In response to Debbie Chacra’s charge to “celebrate and foster education, maintenance, analysis, critique, and, above all, caregiving” in maker cultures, this roundtable imagines pedagogies of e-literary practice that combine creation and caregiving in ways restorative to the ongoing tradition (s) of e-lit (“Beyond Making”). E-lit regularly confronts theoretical, cultural, and material challenges endemic to the field, as genres of previously accessible work are being lost to technological obsolescence and new developments are moving increasingly off the screen and out of practical reach. One way to counter such challenges of these\"(un) continuous\" times is through an integrated, applied, practice-based model of e-lit pedagogy. Participants discuss ways of teaching electronic literature that incorporates hands-on work like critical-creative making and procedural performance as pedagogical responses to rapid technological changes that blot out e-literature’s past and blackbox its future.",

I then perform this sequence through case studies featuring the four narratives introduced above, as possible examples for students and instructors interested in implementing this sequence. I close with suggestions for how a vernacular approach to religion might intersect fruitfully with approaches to literacy that take into account both multiple cultural contexts and multiple media forms. Ultimately, my goal is to offer a multiliteracies-based framework that opens up space for addressing religious dimensions of literacy in composition classroom settings in order to open up space for a richly diverse array of voices, which have much to offer us as scholars and teachers of literate communication.",

As combinations of visual and verbal semiotic channels, comics are excellent resources for communicating multisensory, complex, personally oriented information in engaging ways that may be more accessible to public and scholarly audiences alike. Furthermore, comics make it possible to represent ethnographic human data in ways that both intimately present and distance themselves from human subjects while making the researcher-creator’s interpretive lens unmistakably visible to avoid any illusions of unbiased objectivity. Additionally, digital environments make it possible to embed additional ethnographic data, such as audio or video, and also to improve accessibility through descriptive alt text.

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship in video game design and development has taken an affective turn, asking questions about the individual and collective experiences that games engender in players. For instance, Katherine Isbister, in How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design, explores how the worlds of games extend and persist beyond a specific play-experience into social, nongame environments, claiming that game designers have come to realize that “extended play is far more meaningful when embedded in understandable human social frameworks for collective action”(2017, 123). Through these frameworks we experience sets of values in a game and learn how the systems that structure our play support or challenge them. Games allow us to explore and experiment with values, as well as to learn about the functions of those values within and beyond a game environment (see Anable 2018; Juul 2013; Sicart 2014). Values are social, cultural, technological, and/or institutional conventions, ones that can be altered with purposeful and conscientious design practices (De Koven 2013, 9).\nContributing to the increasing interest in affective game design, Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum propose a three-part method for uncovering values in games and cultivating a design practice for engaging and changing conventional values. Conscientious game design, they write, begins by acknowledging that “(1) there are common (not necessarily universal) values;(2) artifacts may embody ethical and political values; and (3) steps taken in design and development have the power to affect the nature of those values”(2014, 11). Through this recursive design …",

In particular, this comic and accompanying essay focus in on the #FolktaleWeek Challenge as one case example of vernacular narrative sequential art in online spaces that fosters creative community through engagement with folkloric content. Overall, #FolktaleWeek serves to illustrate the significance of folklore-based social media challenges (visual-verbal and otherwise) as spaces for enthusiastic, informal public engagement around folktales and fairy tales. The closing five-page comic gives an overview of the #FolktaleWeek Challenge from 2018–2024 and shares examples from the author's annual participation in the challenge during this period.",

Indeed, modern fairy-tale adaptations, pervading contemporary popular culture, drastically subvert, shatter, and alter the public’s understanding of the classic fairy tale. Because of the phenomenally increasing proliferation of fairy-tale transformations in today’s “old” and “new” media, we must reflect upon the significance of the fairy tale for society and its social uses in a nuanced fashion. How, why, and for whom have fairy-tale narratives, characters, and motifs metamorphosed in recent decades? What significant intermedial and intertextual relationships exist nowadays in connection with the fairy tale? This Special Issue features eleven illuminating articles of thirteen scholars in the fields of folklore and fairy-tale studies, tackling these and other relevant questions.",

In the case of complex products and supply chains, this can lead to suboptimization of the supply chain system. Suboptimization may occur when the pursuit of the lowest piece price actually adds cost to the system. A systems approach to analyzing an entire supply chain to determine nonvalue-added activity—some of which is introduced through the pursuit of low-cost suppliers—can help to optimize and rationalize a supply chain and result in cost savings and efficiency improvements.",

A qualitative research method using hermeneutic phenomenology was used to interpret and understand the experience of stress. The stressors identified by both patient and family participants in this study were shock and disbelief leading to a feeling of being overwhelmed. Among patients, mortality was foremost. Among family caregivers, anger was expressed. The importance of providing information, honesty, and trust were pivotal to alleviating stress.

While several valid and reliable tools to measure the components of the practice environment have been developed by nurse researchers with two measures,, the Practice Environment Scale and Job Enjoyment Scale, are included in the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators®(NDNQI®) RN Satisfaction Survey. Leiter and Lachinger (2006) posited the Nursing Worklife Model (NWLM) to explain how the elements identified are interrelated in the complex system of the nurse practice environment with subsequent work that extended the model to include association of nurse perception of patient adverse events. Further exploration of the impact of the specific elements of the practice environment on patient adverse events is needed. To date, researchers have primarily evaluated the impact of clinical outcomes using administrative data at the hospital or individual nurse level using nurse perceived adverse patient outcomes. In addition to RN Survey data, the NDNQI® provides a database of nurse-sensitive clinical outcomes (eg, urinary tract infections rates) at the unit level. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of elements of the NWLM on a measured nurse-sensitive outcome, catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) at the unit level. Hospital acquired conditions (HACs) related to nosocomial infection are adverse patient events that have a significant impact on financial, morbidity and mortality outcomes.

Experiential dispositions and technology perceptions around a mobile service that is currently in use to access other value-seeking services are integrated to present an enriched characterization of intention to use m-health. Primary data from a pressing health context in a developing economy are collected to validate the model. The results demonstrate that previous experience from value services received on a mobile service enhances user attention, which in turn positively impacts the perceived usefulness of an incoming m-health program, which then influences user intention to adopt m-health services delivered on that mobile service. Overall, the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of user intention to accept m-health. Additionally, our results provide insights toward the choice of mobile technology and indicate aspects of message framing that may ensure practicable deployment and successful implementation of m-health programs.",

Among these planned services, ATM is the most matured service in many private and state owned banks in Ethiopia. ATM is a recent phenomenon in low-income countries (; ), and is still being introduced in financial sectors in low-income countries (Angeli, 2008; ) making investigation of factors of ICT technology adoption in low income countries timely. The authors test context specific applicability of UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model. The authors' analysis of primary data suggests general applicability of the modified UTAUT model in explaining factors and antecedents of technology adoption but also identifies significant differences in the moderating factors of gender and age. Depending on whether they are above or below the age of 30, Ethiopian consumers of banking services exhibit highly differentiated levels of service credibility and technology risk acceptance towards ATM banking. This suggests that banking services sector in low income countries may like to clearly delineate and appropriately differentiate their awareness and reach-out strategies to their customers who belong to one or the other age group. Furthermore, women in this study are found to perceive themselves as more susceptible to fraud and other security risks in ATM banking, suggesting that special design considerations be incorporated in the way locations of ATMs are selected and in the way ATM technology features are accessed to ally such fears. The authors' work also shows research directions where other scholars may investigate an otherwise much diffused technology adoption in the low income countries of the world.",

We analyze the problem using a game between a government, an infrastructural firm, and an attacker. If the attacker successfully breaches the IT security defenses of the infrastructural firm, primary losses accrue to that firm, while widespread collateral losses accrue to the rest of the economy. The government assists the infrastructural firm by providing intelligence inputs about an impending attack. We find that subject to some conditions, expenditure on intelligence adds value only when its amount exceeds a threshold level. Also, the nature of the equilibrium depends on the level of government expenditure in intelligence. We find that the optimal level of intelligence expenditure can change in seemingly unexpected ways in response to a shift in parameters. For example, reduced vulnerability of the infrastructural firm does not necessarily imply a reduction in intelligence-gathering effort. We also exhibit circumstances under which a system of centralized security in which the government regulates both intelligence gathering as well as the system inspection regime of the infrastructural firm may not always be desirable because of strategic interactions between the players.

This research attempts to analyze similar impact of plausible IT security information overload on the IT security behavior of organizational end-users. A hierarchical model of the impact of information overload on organizational end-usersâ IT security behavior is proposed here.

Sharing data and information assets with other firms may give rise to external seats of loss exposure. Together, these practices complicate the IT security risk in business relationship: misaligned incentive for IT security investment and free rider behavior arise. Naïve pursuit to enter into business relationships using Internet-based technologies can prove myopic because the IT security risk profile of the resultant B2B network may be untenable. This research exhibits the impact of sharing and linking of information and network assets on IT security risk in modern business relationship with the help of a 2-firm symmetric B2B. This work demonstrates why managers should consider expanding their business relationship to include IT security initiatives as well, especially when they employ Internet-based technologies to interlink their networks.",

This practice enables breach incidence to travel from one firm to another, making the IT security risks of the firms strategically interdependent. The present practice of multilayered defense against IT breaches resembles stage-gates, bringing operational interdependency between the successive layers of defense in a B2B firm. Such inter-firm and inter-layer interdependences in B2B relationship ultimately results in complex decision scenarios in the IT security regime. We propose a comprehensive game theoretic model to capture the above complex, intertwined interdependencies of IT security risk in B2B firms.

Both of these approaches have significant implications when a security breach occurs. One, the interconnections may become conduits for security breach propagation. Two, shared information assets now become vulnerable at the owner as well as at the partner firmsâ sites. Therefore, an effective security investment strategy in a supply chain must take into account vulnerability issues arising out of propagation of security breaches and sharing of information assets. Investments in perimeter security technologies reduce direct vulnerability of information assets, but are ineffective in countering indirect breaches, which originate from partnering firms.

The primary goal of this study is to analyze how students in traditionally developed courses and those in collaboratively developed courses differ. Specifically, we sought to reduce variability in student satisfaction across multiple sections offered by instructors who hail from different universities. We compared three semesters of students who took the course before (n = 101) and after (n = 162) use of the agile course development process. We found less variability in student evaluations in the ‘after’ group as compared to the ‘before’ group, providing support that the agile course development process provided a more consistent and similar experience for students. The second goal is to evaluate changes in student evaluations, comparing ‘before’ and ‘after’ groups. We did not expect to see substantial improvement since all instructors already received very high evaluations. Scores for all questions on the student evaluations increased after using the agile process, but the increases were not statistically significant. The final goal is to prepare an agenda for future research on agile course development based on components of The Agile Manifesto that were not used in the course development process. Opportunities include: comparing the agile course development process to other methods; adding more targeted questions to the student survey to better gauge changes in student satisfaction; partnering with alumni, current students, and industry to develop more relevant course material; and extending the process to other contexts.",

We propose a game theoretic model to analyze the equilibrium IT security of the supply chain in the Stackelberg game, where the power structure in the supply chain manifests in a natural leader. Our results indicate that a natural leader-follower framework ensures higher IT security in the chain than the decentralized decision scenario. However, our results also exhibit that the total cost of IT security is disproportionately divided between the firms of the supply chain. In equilibrium, the leader not only commits first, it must also commit at a higher level than the follower. General comparison with the centralized case as well as the sensitivity of IT security investment of the leader/follower firm on key network parameters is also analyzed.",

Explosive computing and communicating power with ever-decreasing price of service over the passage of time have been the hallmark of this success. The success of these technologies has been effectively appropriated in many business processes and systems including the banking sector and the social media applications. However, in spite of having stupendous potential in the healthcare sector, especially in providing access to service for patients in rural and difficult-to-reach areas, very limited ICT appropriation has been witnessed. The authors explain the current extent of ICT penetration and seek reasons for such lackluster inclusion of ICT and mobile technology in the healthcare sector. They use the TAM model to identify the critical factors of technology adoption, and use such understandings to help readers understand the barriers of adoption of ICT and mobile technologies in the healthcare sector. The authors also provide indicative guidelines about how such barriers may be overcome, and widespread adoption and deployment of these technologies can be made possible in the healthcare sector, yielding benefits to large sections of population in the US.",

Initial results suggest that obsolescence is neither perceived as a critical factor during planning for systems development, nor is it viewed as a major contributor to the total cost of operation of client/server systems. However, the survey does identify that organizations have a number of valid and functional coping strategies when obsolescence does affect systems operations.",

Respondents of the HLIs demonstrated adequate understanding of IT outsourcing processes, yet the HLIs were found to have no structured or documented outsourcing strategy, policy or program in place. Risk management frameworks for IT outsourcing projects were either absent or not documented. Overall, the findings reveal a general lack of appreciation for needs of structure and documentation in all aspects of outsourcing contracts. As a result, the risk management practices of the HLIs are found to depend largely on intuitions and previous experiences.",

The proposed model characterizes the minimum budget below which a defending nation cannot feasibly contemplate to deploy more than one layer of defense against cyber terrorism. Beyond budgetary considerations, the paper also calculates the relative technological capabilities that the defending nation must possess to deploy a detection regime behind the first layer of protection regime. Finally, the author calculates and presents the optimal bifurcation of budget between the prevention and detection regimes should the defending nation possesses adequate funds to deploy layered defense in cyber terrorism.",

This translates into a scenario where firms with similar information assets engage in a veiled race so as not to appear as the soft target in the focus group. In this work we propose a duopolistic model and utilize a differential game framework to analyze the IT security investment decisions of two firms who find themselves in such a short list of hacking targets and must compete dynamically on their IT security investments to reduce the risk of being breached. We provide the steady state (singular region) analysis of the differential game for two firms with symmetric and asymmetric parameters. Our model exhibits that hacker learning and firms’ security investment efficiency have opposite effects on the two equilibrium outcomes of interest, namely, the security level and the security investment rate. As hacker learning improves (security investment efficiency increases), the security levels and security investment rate of the two firms move apart (closer).",

Data mining analysis was utilized to extract and calculate the frequencies of morally relevant words from the website content. There were significant effects for the individual characteristic of political orientation. Additionally, all school-related factors were significant. Only main effects were observed for some school-related factors (i.e., average SAT score, institution type, frequency of morally relevant words in mission statements, value statements and course catalogs). For other school-related factors (i.e., the region, student–faculty ratio and racial composition), main effects were also observed; however, these effects were particularly illuminating given their interactions with political orientation.

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of hemeoxygenases HO‐1 and HO‐2, which are responsible for the production of carbon monoxide (CO), in the human placenta and placental bed and to determine the role of inhibitors of HO on placental perfusion pressure. We hypothesized that HO is expressed within the placenta and that invading cytotrophoblast cells (CTB) express HO isoforms. The expression of HO‐1 and HO‐2 was studied on placenta and placental bed biopsies, obtained using a transcervical sampling technique, from normal human pregnancies between 8 and 19 wk gestation and at term. In the placenta, HO‐2 immunostaining was prominent in syncytiotrophoblast in the first trimester and reduced toward term ( P &lt;0.0005). HO‐2 endothelial immunostaining was weak in the first trimester, but increased by term ( P &lt;0.0005). Within the placental bed, HO‐2 was expressed by CTB in cell columns, the cytotrophoblast shell, and cell islands. Both intravascular CTB and interstitial CTB expressed HO‐2. HO‐1 immunostaining was low in the placenta but intense on the CTB within the placental bed. A striking feature was the absence of HO‐1 from the proximal layers of cell columns, with strong expression on the more distal CTB layers of the cell columns. In placental perfusion studies, a significant dose‐dependent increase in perfusion pressure was observed in the presence of zinc protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO. These results suggest a role for CO in placental function, trophoblast invasion, and spiral artery transformation.

EMD 61753 binds with high affinity (IC 50 5.6 n m ) and selectivity ( k :μ:δ:σ binding ratio 1:536: 125: &gt; 1,786) to k ‐opioid receptors and is a full and potent (IC 50 54.5 n m ) agonist in an in vitro assay for k ‐opioid receptors (rabbit vas deferens preparation). Systemically‐applied [ 14 C]‐EMD 61753 is found in high concentrations in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands and kidneys. Considerably less radioactivity is detected in the whole brain, and this radioactivity is concentrated in the region of the cerebral ventricles in the choroid plexuses. EMD 61753 penetrates only poorly into the CNS. EMD 61753 was weakly effective in pharmacological tests of central activity.

Placental protein expression was determined by Western blotting ( n =10 in each group) and immunohistochemistry (controls n =18, PE n =19, FGR n =10). Extravillous trophoblast expression was determined by immunohistochemistry of placental bed biopsy samples (controls n= 17, PE n =19, FGR n =10). Western blot analysis of placental homogenates showed no overall differences in HO‐2 among groups. However, immunohistochemical analysis showed a reduction in HO‐2 expression in endothelial cells in both abnormal groups (PE P &lt;0.01;FGR P &lt;0.0005 vs. control group) but no differences in villous trophoblast staining. HO‐1 was undetectable by Western blotting in control and abnormal pregnancies and immunoreactivity was very low, suggesting that there is little HO‐1 in the placenta. Within the placental bed, HO‐2 but not HO‐1 was detected on all populations of extravillous trophoblast, but expression of HO‐2 or HO‐1 did not change in PE or FGR. The reduced expression of HO‐2 on endothelial cells in PE and FGR may be responsible for reduced placental blood flow in these conditions.

          "abstract": "Despite the recent introduction of a number of new compounds, there has of late been a cooling of interest by pharmaceutical companies in the development of centrally-active, selective kappa opioid agonists for therapeutic purposes. This is reflected in the discontinuation of a number of clinical trials, for reasons that are often not completely clear to outside observers. Spiradoline and enadoline have apparently been abandoned as potential analgesics because they induce dose-limiting central side-effects (i.e., dysphoria) in models of post-surgical pain. The development of niravoline as an aquaretic for the treatment of cirrhosis with ascites and other hyponatraemic disorders has also been halted. Enadoline may yet find some application against ischaemic stroke and severe head injury, presumably in comatose patients in whom psychiatric side-effects are taken to be immaterial, while apadoline and TRK 820 remain in Phase II clinical testing against cancer pain. The peripherally-selective kappa agonists, asimadoline, and the atypical compound, fedotozine, are well-tolerated in man. Results of Phase III trials of fedotozine against irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia have, however, ultimately been disappointing, whereas asimadoline is currently in Phase II clinical trials against pain of rheumatic and osteoarthritic origin. The results of these trials are eagerly awaited.",

EMD 60400 and ICI 197067 bind with high affinity (IC50 values of 2.8 and 1.5 nM, respectively) and high selectivity to kappa-opioid receptors. ICI 204448 has a lower binding affinity (IC50 13.0 nM) and selectivity for kappa-opioid receptors. 3. EMD 60400, ICI 197067, and ICI 204448 are full and potent agonists in the rabbit vas deferens in vitro assay for kappa-opioid receptors (IC50 values of 41.8, 15.7 and 15 nM, respectively). 4. Ex vivo binding experiments in mice revealed that EMD 60400 and ICI 197067 were well taken up after s.c. administration. Brain levels of EMD 60400 were lower than those of ICI 197067 at comparable doses, indicating that EMD 60400 does not penetrate into the CNS as well as ICI 197067. 5.

We investigated the effects of PIEs on human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) to understand if such exposures cause damage and dysfunction to respiratory epithelia. Primary HNECs from male and female donors were cultured at air–liquid interface (ALI), and 16HBE cells were cultured on coverslips. Smoke condensates were generated from incineration of plastic at flaming (640°C) and smoldering (500°C) temperatures, and cells were subsequently exposed to these materials at 5–50 μg/cm2 concentrations. HNECs were assessed for mitochondrial dysfunction and 16HBE cells for glutathione oxidation in real-time analyses. HNEC culture supernatants and total RNA were collected at 4-h postexposure for cytokine and gene expression analysis, and results show that PIEs can acutely induce inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in HNECs, and that incineration temperature modifies biological responses. Specifically, condensates from flaming and smoldering PIEs significantly increased HNEC secretion of cytokines IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-13, as well as expression of xenobiotic metabolism pathways and genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 at 5 and 20 μg/cm2 concentrations. Only 50 μg/cm2 flaming PIEs significantly increased glutathione oxidation in 16HBEs, and decreased respiration and ATP production in HNEC mitochondria. Impact Statement: Our data reveal the impact of incineration temperatures on biological outcomes associated with PIE exposures, emphasizing the importance of temperature as a factor when evaluating respiratory disease associated with PIEs exposure.",

It exhibits antihyperalgesic activity in animal models of inflammatory pain at doses which do not cause signs of central action. The structure of this compound was varied in different ways and the resulting derivatives were tested for affinity to the kappa-receptor. Furthermore, those compounds with binding values comparable to that of EMD 61753 were tested for central activity. This was done by measuring the extent to which the haloperidol-induced L-DOPA accumulation in the nucleus accumbens of the rat could be reversed after application of 10 mg/kg s.c. of the test compound.

We determined how often diagnostic testing was pursued, the outcome of diagnostic testing, and how often pulmonary nodules were given a definitive diagnosis. Method A retrospective review of patients found to have pulmonary nodules. Patients with oncologic diagnoses were excluded. Data collected included number of nodules, presence of pre‐existing systemic disease, laboratory testing, presence of respiratory symptoms, repeat imaging, biopsy result, and final diagnosis. Results We identified 88 patients, of which 56 (64%) had a single nodule, 21 (24%) had a pre‐existing nononcologic systemic disease, and four patients (5%) had a new systemic disease identified at the same time the nodule(s) was found. In otherwise healthy patients presenting with a solitary nodule, 94% did not have a definitive diagnosis and none went on to be diagnosed with systemic disease. Serum infectious work‐up result for tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, or aspergillosis was not significantly different between single and multiple nodule/systemic illness groups. No previously healthy patients presenting with a solitary nodule were later diagnosed with malignancy. Conclusion Diagnostic workup for a solitary pulmonary nodule was often inconclusive, especially if the patient did not have symptoms at presentation. Pulmonary nodules were not the sole presenting sign of systemic disease for any subjects. We suggest that in an otherwise healthy pediatric patient found to have an asymptomatic single pulmonary nodule, observation without laboratory work‐up or repeat imaging is a reasonable option.",

          "abstract": "We examined whether increases in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability occurring after stroke can be exploited to apply protective substances selectively to ischemic tissue. To do this, the actions of the peripherally selective OP2 agonists, EMD-61569 and EMD-61747, have been compared with those of the centrally acting OP2 agonist, GR-89696, in the rat permanent focal ischemia model. EMD-61569, EMD-61747 and GR-89696 all bound with high affinity to OP2 receptors and were potent agonists in the rabbit vas deferens functional assay. These substances also potently inhibited electrically-induced overflow of dopamine from slices of rat nucleus accumbens. EMD-61747 and EMD-61569 penetrate poorly into the CNS under normal conditions and reverse haloperidol-induced L-DOPA accumulation in the nucleus accumbens of the rat only at high doses, in contrast to GR-89696. Permanent unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) was associated with a disruption of the BBB and an increase in the concentration of EMD-61747 in the area of the infarct. GR-89696 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg s.c. produced a reduction in infarct volume by 38% after MCAO, EMD-61569 and EMD-61747 had no influence on swelling and ischemic damage. We conclude that EMD-61747 and EMD-61569 are potent OP2 agonists, which usually have a limited ability to penetrate the BBB. The change in the properties of the BBB in ischemic tissue was not sufficient to elicit neuroprotection, since both EMD-61747 and EMD-61569 were inactive in the focal ischemia model. Conversely, GR-89696 had a robust protective action, and probably powerful OP2-typical side effects as a consequence of its unrestricted central activity.",

While scholars have argued that voter experiences affect satisfaction, confidence, and trust more broadly, often absent from this conversation is the unique role that poll workers play in shaping citizen confidence. For racial and ethnic minorities, descriptive representation in public institutions has a positive effect on trust in administrative procedures. However, the relationship between descriptive representation and confidence in local election administration has received limited attention. Utilizing the Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE), we investigate the influence of poll workers on citizen confidence in local election operations. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between citizen interaction with racially/ethnically congruent poll workers and trust in American elections for African American and Hispanic voters. Findings indicate that for African American and Hispanic voters, in-person interaction with a poll worker of the same race/ethnicity increases general confidence in election administration.",

Specifically, we surveyed K-12 teachers’ perceptions of their decision-making power after the passage of legislation limiting the discussion of divisive topics in the classroom. Previous scholarship suggests that discretion-as-perceived is affected by the degree of powerlessness street-level bureaucrats feel in the implementation of a policy. The results of our study indicate that teachers perceive a significant loss of discretion following the passage of such legislation. Those views are shaped by personal and professional factors like race and specialization.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores students’ perspectives on divisive concepts. Divisive concepts is a term recently used by legislators to describe coursework and training that address the experiences of race, gender, and sexuality among marginalized groups from the perspective of systemic oppression and marginalization. Federal, state, and local leaders have moved to regulate the discussion of these concepts in U.S. classrooms and workplaces. Legislators argue that these concepts lead to negative feelings of guilt, blame, and discomfort for students—specifically White students. Recent research suggests that these legislative challenges have impacted classroom instruction. Some states have also attempted to regulate divisive concepts in higher education, but there is little evidence of this concern among college students. This study focuses on the following research questions: “How do college students perceive divisive concepts like privilege and oppression? What are the key predictors of these attitudes?” To address these questions, I collected opinion data from college students in introductory American Government courses from 2022 to 2024 ( n = 2487). The findings suggest that, in general, college students support discussions of divisive concepts but note the difficult environment it may create. The data show that student attitudes vary across demographic groups.",

Five hundred Family Treatment Courts (FTC) operate across the country to combat the growing problem of women addicted to drugs. The FTC model provides mothers with substance addiction treatment, intensive judicial monitoring, repeated drug testing, counseling, incentives or sanctions, and case management with the goal of reaching long‐term sobriety and reunification with their children. Design This retrospective study examined the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and substance use characteristics, in predicting participants' graduations from the FTC program. Methods Data were gathered from 317 participants from five Family Treatment Courts in the southeastern United States and analyzed using logistic regression. Results Participants who completed the FTC program were more likely to be older, completed Cognitive Behavioral Training, completed high school, and Caucasian. Conclusion Age and completion of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy were the greatest predictors of graduating from the Family Treatment Court. These results convey the need for development of interventions tailored to each participant's age to maximize the success of the FTC participants. In addition, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy should be integrated into all FTC programs. Clinical Relevance The findings from this study will offer research scholars a foundation for designing future studies, aid researchers in creating interventions to increase success in substance addiction treatment programs, and contribute to the framework for theory development. In addition, understanding characteristics that may influence graduation from the Family Treatment Court will provide valuable information on developing interventions to support participants' success.",

During past human trafficking extraction operations, law enforcement and the state sexual assault nurse examiner coordinator recognized the need to meet the patients' immediate physical and emotional needs while providing essential comfort to the newly extracted individuals. To meet the immediate holistic healthcare needs during the recovery operation, the nursing faculty partnered with a local nonprofit community clinic to provide onsite trauma‐informed, patient‐centered healthcare and comfort items. The healthcare team consisted of advanced practice nurses, mental health nurses who triaged the patient's immediate psychological needs, sexual assault nurses who collected forensic specimens, and nurses with expertise in substance use disorder who evaluated the patient's treatment needs. The patient's physical comfort was met by providing hygiene kits, blankets, socks, food, and drinks. Trauma‐informed language was utilized to help the patient feel safe and to convey respect for the patient's autonomy in making decisions during the extraction process. The innovative community‐academic nursing partnership laid the groundwork for providing healthcare to future human trafficking extraction operations with plans to incorporate nursing students and graduate nursing students to increase the number of patients served while providing a rich learning experience to the students.",

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) stabilized by polyguanidino oxanorbornenes (PG) at 5 and 25 kDa and polyamino oxanorbornenes (PA) at 3 and 15 kDa have been synthesized by the reduction of silver ions with NaBH4 in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The four different silver nanoparticles have been characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for their particle size distributions. Interestingly, PG stabilizes the silver nanoparticles better than PA as evident from our spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the AgNP-PG-5K (5K = 5 kDa) was found to serve as an effective catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4. The reduction has a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 5.50 × 10(-3) s(-1) and an activity parameter of 1375 s(-1) g(-1), which is significantly higher than other systems reported in the literature.",

For example, when an acidic stock solution of protonated V(10) is placed in a reverse micelle, the (51)V chemical shifts show that the V(10) is deprotonated consistent with a decreased proton concentration in the intramicellar water pool. Results indicate that a proton gradient exists inside the reverse micelles, leaving the interior neutral while the interfacial region is acidic.",

The information gained in such studies depends substantially on the location of the probe used. Often, intuition leads to the assumption that ionic probe molecules reside in the polar water pool of a system. In this work, the location of a charged polar transition metal coordination complex in a reverse micellar system is determined using NMR spectroscopy. Despite the expected Coulomb repulsion between the surfactant headgroups and the negatively charged complex, the complex spends significant time penetrating into the hydrophobic portion of the reverse micellar interface. These results challenge the assumption that ionic probe molecules reside solvated by water in microheterogeneous environments and suggest that probe molecule location be carefully considered before interpreting data from similar systems.",

Esters of the type VO(xsal)(HL), 2, are obtained by reacting H(2)L with VO(xsal)(H(2)O) or VO(xsal)(OMe)(HOMe), where xsal(2-) is the diionized salicylaldimine of glycine (x = g), L-alanine (x = a), or L-valine (x = v). The reaction of VO(acac)(2) with H(2)L and the salicylaldimine (Hpsal) of 2-picolylamine has furnished VO(psal)(L), 3. In the structures of VO(gsal)(HL(1)), 2a, and VO(vsal)(HL(2)), 2f, the HL(-) ligand is O,O-chelated, the phenolic oxygen lying trans to the oxo oxygen atom. The xsal(2-) coligand has a folded structure and the conformation of 2f is exclusively endo. In both 2a and 2f the phenolic oxygen atom is strongly hydrogen bonded (O...O, 2.60 A) to a carboxylic oxygen atom of a neighboring molecule. In VO(psal)(L(2)).H(2)O, 3b, the diionized diol is O,O-chelated to the metal and the water molecule is hydrogen bonded to a phenoxidic oxygen atom (O.O, 2.84 A). The C-O and C-C distances in the V(diol) fragment reveal that 2 is a pure catecholate and 3 is a catecholate-semiquinonate hybrid. In solution each ester gives rise to a single (51)V NMR signal (no diastereoisomers), which generally shifts downfield with a decrease in the ester LMCT band energy. The V(V)/V(IV) and catecholate-semiquinonate reduction potentials lie near -0.75 and 0.35, and 1.10 and 0.70 V vs SCE for 2 and 3, respectively. Molecular oxygen reacts smoothly with 2 quantitatively furnishing the corresponding o-quinone, and in the presence of H(2)L the reaction becomes catalytic. In contrast, type 3 esters are inert to oxygen. The initial binding of O(2) to 2 is proposed to occur via hydrogen bonding with chelated HL(-).",

This class of vanadium compounds was chosen for investigation because of their seven-coordinate vanadium atom, a geometry for which there is limited (51)V SSNMR data. Furthermore, a systematic series of compounds with different electronic properties are available and allows for the effects of ligand substitution on the NMR parameters to be studied. The quadrupolar coupling constants, C(Q), are small, 3.0-3.9 MHz, but exhibit variations as a function of the ligand substitution. The chemical shift tensors in the solid state are sensitive to changes in both the hydroxylamide substituent and the dipic ligand, a sensitivity which is not observed for isotropic chemical shifts in solution. The chemical shift tensors span approximately 1000 ppm and are nearly axially symmetric. On the basis of DFT calculations of the chemical shift tensors, one of the largest contributors to the magnetic shielding anisotropy is an occupied molecular orbital with significant vanadium d(z)2 character along the V=O bond.",

The ability of vanadate to act either as a phosphate analogue or as a transition-state analogue with enzymes' catalysis phosphoryl group transfer suggests that vanadium coordination compounds may reveal mechanistic preferences in these classes of enzymes. Two of these compounds investigated, PDC-V(V) and BMOV, were hydrolytically and oxidatively reactive at neutral pH, and one, HAIDA-V(IV), does not hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise decompose to a measurable extent during the enzyme assay. The SR Ca (2+)-ATPase was inhibited by all three of these complexes. The relative order of inhibition was PDC-V(V) > BMOV > vanadate > HAIDA-V(IV), and the IC 50 values were 25, 40, 80, and 325 microM, respectively. Because the observed inhibition is more potent for PDC-V(V) and BMOV than that of oxovanadates, the inhibition cannot be explained by oxovanadate formation during enzyme assays. Furthermore, the hydrolytically and redox stable amavadine analogue HAIDA-V(IV) inhibited the Ca (2+)-ATPase less than oxovanadates. To gauge the importance of the lipid environment, studies of oxidized BMOV in microemulsions were performed and showed that this system remained in the aqueous pool even though PDC-V(V) is able to penetrate lipid interfaces. These findings suggest that the hydrolytic properties of these complexes may be important in the inhibition of the calcium pump. Our results show that two simple coordination complexes with known insulin enhancing effects can invoke a response in calcium homeostasis and the regulation of muscle contraction through the SR Ca (2+)-ATPase.",

(1)H NMR spectra can be used for detailed characterization of reactions in confined environments when counterion effects are likely to be important. (1)H NMR spectroscopy revealed two separate peaks corresponding to water in Mg(AOT)2 samples; one peak arises from water coordinated to the Mg(2+) ion while the other peak arises from bulk water. The two water signals arise directly from the slow exchange of the water coordinated to Mg(2+) in these microemulsions with water in the water pool, and provide an opportunity to study hydration of Mg(2+).

However, microemulsions can form with a polar phase other than water, which hold promise to diversify the range of properties, and hence utility, of microemulsions. Here microemulsions formed by using a room‐temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as the polar phase were created and characterized by using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. 1 H, 11 B, and 19 F NMR spectroscopy was applied to explore differences between microemulsions formed by using 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF 4 ]) as the polar phase with a cationic surfactant, benzylhexadecyldimethylammonium chloride (BHDC), and a nonionic surfactant, Triton X‐100 (TX‐100). NMR spectroscopy showed distinct differences in the behavior of the RTIL as the charge of the surfactant head group varies in the different microemulsion environments. Minor changes in the chemical shifts were observed for [bmim] + and [BF 4 ] − in the presence of TX‐100 suggesting that the surfactant and the ionic liquid are separated in the microemulsion. The large changes in spectroscopic parameters observed are consistent with microstructure formation with layering of [bmim] + and [BF 4 ] − and migration of Cl − within the BHDC microemulsions. Comparisons with NMR results for related ionic compounds in organic and aqueous environments as well as literature studies assisted the development of a simple organizational model for these microstructures.",

Some changes in properties can be attributed to the interaction of water molecules with the micellar interface, forming a layer of shell water inside the reverse micelle. The work reported here monitors changes in intramicellar water through chemical shifts and signal line widths in 51V NMR spectra of a large polyoxometalate probe, decavanadate, and from infrared spectroscopy of isotopically labeled water, to obtain information on the water in the water pool in AOT reverse micelles formed in isooctane. The studies reveal several things about the reverse micellar water pool. First, in agreement with our previous measurements, the proton equilibrium of the decavanadate solubilized within the reverse micelles differs from that in bulk aqueous solution, indicating a more basic environment compared to the starting stock solutions from which the reverse micelles were formed. Below a certain size, reverse micelles do not form when the polyoxometalate is present; this indicates that the polyanionic probe requires a layer of water to solvate it in addition to the water that solvates the surfactant headgroups. Finally, the polyoxometalate probe appears to perturb the water hydrogen-bonding network in a fashion similar to that in the interior surface of the reverse micelles. These measurements demonstrate the dramatic differences possible for water environments in confined spaces.",

Moreover, disruption of these structures, which are typically enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol, results in insulin resistance. Treatment strategies for insulin resistance include the use of vanadium (V) compounds which have been shown in animal models to enhance insulin responsiveness. One possible mechanism for insulin‐enhancing effects might involve direct effects of V compounds on membrane lipid organization. These changes in lipid organization promote the partitioning of insulin receptors and other receptors into membrane microdomains where receptors are optimally functional. To explore this possibility, we have used several strategies involving V complexes such as [VO 2 (dipic)] − (pyridin‐2,6‐dicarboxylatodioxovanadium(V)), decavanadate (V 10 O , V 10 ), BMOV (bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV)), and [VO(saltris)] 2 (2‐salicylideniminato‐2‐(hydroxymethyl)‐1,3‐dihydroxypropane‐oxovanadium(V)). Our strategies include an evaluation of interactions between V‐containing compounds and model lipid systems, an evaluation of the effects of V compounds on lipid fluidity in erythrocyte membranes, and studies of the effects of V‐containing compounds on signaling events initiated by receptors known to use membrane microdomains as signaling platforms.",

          "abstract": "V 51 solid-state NMR and density functional theory (DFT) investigations are reported for a series of pentacoordinate dioxovanadium(V)-dipicolinate [V(V)O2-dipicolinate] and heptacoordinate aquahydroxylamidooxovanadium(V)-dipicolinate [V(V)O-dipicolinate] complexes. These compounds are of interest because of their potency as phosphatase inhibitors as well as their insulin enhancing properties and potential for the treatment of diabetes. Experimental solid-state NMR results show that the electric field gradient tensors in the V(V)O2-dipicolinate derivatives are affected significantly by substitution on the dipicolinate ring and range from 5.8to8.3MHz. The chemical shift anisotropies show less dramatic variations with respect to the ligand changes and range between −550 and −600ppm. To gain insights on the origins of the NMR parameters, DFT calculations were conducted for an extensive series of the V(V)O2- and V(V)O-dipicolinate complexes. To assess the level of theory required for the accurate calculation of the V51 NMR parameters, different functionals, basis sets, and structural models were explored in the DFT study. It is shown that the original x-ray crystallographic geometries, including all counterions and solvation water molecules within 5Å of the vanadium, lead to the most accurate results. The choice of the functional and the basis set at a high level of theory has a relatively minor impact on the outcome of the chemical shift anisotropy calculations; however, the use of large basis sets is necessary for accurate calculations of the quadrupole coupling constants for several compounds of the V(V)O2 series. These studies demonstrate that even though the vanadium compounds under investigations exhibit distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry, they have a “perfect” trigonal bipyramidal electronic environment. This observation could potentially explain why vanadate and vanadium(V) adducts are often recognized as potent transition state analogs.",

Here, we present a new tool, a series of aqueous oxovanadium(V) reactions, to probe pH, viscosity, and ionic strength in the aqueous interior of reverse micelles. In addition to their potential as anionic probe analogues to phosphates, simple oxovanadium(V) compounds have equilibrium characteristics in aqueous media exquisitely sensitive to their environment. Therefore, the speciation of vanadate equilibria can be used as a parameter to characterize the intramicellar medium. Vanadate speciation is monitored through 51V NMR spectroscopy, which also yields information through chemical shifts and linewidths of spectral features. The speciation observed suggests that the relative acidity of a basic vanadate stock solution is slightly reduced in large, w0 >or= 12, reverse micelles, but that for smaller reverse micelles, speciation reflects the strong interaction of these negatively charged oxometalates with the reverse micelle and suggest an increased solution viscosity in the reverse micelles. This interpretation is obtained through different responses closely linked to the reverse micellar size and the specific conditions in the stock solutions used to form reverse micelles.",

However, physicochemical and cellular barriers encumber the development of viable formulations for future clinical translation. To circumvent these limitations, we have synthesized EM011-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes to improve solubility and enhance therapeutic index of EM011. Phase solubility analysis indicated that EM011 formed a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with β-CD and methyl-β-CD, with a stability constant (K(c)) of 2.42 × 10(-3) M and 4.85 × 10(-3) M, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested the penetrance of either a O-CH(2) or OCH(3)-C(6)H(4)-OCH(3) moiety of EM011 in the β-CD or methyl-β-CD cavity. In addition, multifarious techniques, namely, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and computational studies validated the cage complex of EM011 with β-CD and methyl-β-CD. Moreover, rotating frame overhauser enhancement spectroscopy showed that the H(a) proton of the OCH(3)-C(6)H(4)-OCH(3) moiety was in close proximity with H3 proton of the β-CD or methyl-β-CD cavity. Furthermore, we found that the solubility of EM011 in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) was enhanced by ~11 fold and ~21 fold upon complexation with β-CD and methyl-β-CD, respectively. The enhanced dissolution of the drug CD-complexes in aqueous phase remarkably decreased their IC(50) to 28.5 μM (9-Br-Nos-β-CD) and 12.5 μM (9-Br-Nos-methyl-β-CD) in PC-3 cells compared to free EM011 (~200 μM). This is the first report to demonstrate the novel construction of cylcodextrin-based nanosupramolecular vehicles for enhanced delivery of EM011 that warrants in vivo evaluation for the superior management of prostate cancer.",

          "abstract": "The possibility that a negatively charged organic molecule penetrates the lipid interface in a reverse micellar system is examined using UV-vis absorption and NMR spectroscopy. The hypothesis that deprotonated forms of dipicolinic acid, H(2)dipic, such as Hdipic(-) and dipic(2-), can penetrate the lipid interface in a microemulsion is based on our previous finding that the insulin-enhancing anionic [VO(2)dipic](-) complex was found to reside in the hydrophobic layer of the reverse micelle (Crans et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 4437-4445). Penetration of a polar and charged compound, namely Hdipic(-) or dipic(2-), into a hydrophobic environment is perhaps unexpected given the established rules regarding the fundamental properties of compound solubility. As such, this work has broad implications in organic chemistry and other disciplines of science. These studies required a comprehensive investigation of the different dipic species and their association in aqueous solutions at varying pH values. Combining the aqueous studies using absorption and NMR spectroscopy with those in microemulsions defines the differences observed in the heterogeneous environment. Despite the expected repulsion between the surfactant head groups and the dianionic probe molecule, these studies demonstrate that dipic resides deep in the hydrophobic portion of the reverse micellar interface. In summary, these results provide evidence that ionic molecules can reside in nonpolar locations in microheterogeneous environments. This suggests that additional factors such as solvation are important to molecule location. Documented ability to penetrate lipid surfaces of similar charge provides a rationale for why specific drugs with less than optimal hydrophobicity are successful even though they violate Lipinski's rules.",

Phase-solubility analysis suggested that Red-Br-Nos complexed with β-CD and methyl-β-CD in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with a stability constant (Kc) of 2.29 × 10(3) M(-1) and 4.27 × 10(3) M(-1). Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy indicated entrance of an O-CH₂ or OCH₃-C₆H₄-OCH₃ moiety of Red-Br-Nos in the β-CD or methyl-β-CD cavity. Furthermore, the cage complex of Red-Br-Nos with β-CD and methyl-β-CD was validated by several spectral techniques. Rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy revealed that the Ha proton of the OCH₃-C₆H₄-OCH₃ moiety was closer to the H₅ proton of β-CD and the H₃ proton of the methyl-β-CD cavity. The solubility of Red-Br-Nos in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH ∼ 7.4) was improved by ∼10.7-fold and ∼21.2-fold when mixed with β-CD and methyl-β-CD, respectively. This increase in solubility led to a favorable decline in the IC₅₀ by ∼2-fold and ∼3-fold for Red-Br-Nos-β-CD-GGM and Red-Br-Nos-methyl-β-CD-GGM formulations respectively, compared to free Red-Br-Nos-β-CD and Red-Br-Nos-methyl-β-CD in human colon HT-29 cells. GGM-bearing drug complex formulations were found to be highly cytotoxic to the HT-29 cell line and further effective with simultaneous continuous release of Red-Br-Nos from microspheres.

The X-ray crystal structures of Na[VO2dipic-NH2].2H2O (2) and K[VO2dipic-NO2] (3) show the vanadium adopting a distorted, trigonal-bipyramidal coordination environment similar to the parent coordination complex, [VO2dipic]- (1), reported previously as the Cs+ salt. The observed differences in the chemical shifts of the complexes both in the 1H (ca. 0.7-1.4 ppm) and 51V (ca. 1-11 ppm) NMR spectra were consistent with the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing properties of the substituent groups, respectively. Stoichiometric addition of a series of hydroxylamine ligands (H2NOH, MeHNOH, Me2NOH, and Et2NOH) to complexes 1-3 led to the formation of seven-coordinate vanadium(V) complexes. The X-ray crystal structure of [VO(dipic)(Me2NO)(H2O)].0.5H2O (1c) was found to be similar to the previously characterized complexes [VO(dipic)(H2NO)(H2O)] (1a) and [VO(dipic)(OO-tBu)(H2O)]. While only slight differences in the 1H NMR spectra were observed upon addition of the hydroxylamido ligand, the signals in the 51V NMR spectra change by up to 100 ppm. The addition of the hydroxylamido ligand increased the complex stability of complexes 2 and 3. Evidence for a nonstoichiometric redox reaction was found for the monoalkyl hydroxylamine ligand. The reaction of an unsaturated five-coordinate species with a hydroxylamine to form a seven-coordinate vanadium complex will, in general, dramatically increase the amounts of the vanadium compound that remain intact at pH values near neutral.",

The fundamental interactions of CO(2) with water, particularly in nanosized structures, may influence a wide range of processes in our technological society. Here results from experiments investigating the uptake of gaseous CO(2) by water pools in reverse micelles are presented. Despite the small number of water molecules in each droplet, changes in vanadium probes within the water pools, measured using vanadium-51 NMR spectroscopy, indicate a significant drop in pH after CO(2) introduction. Collectively, the pH-dependent vanadium probes show CO(2) dissolves in the nanowater droplets, causing the reverse micelle acidity to increase.",

          "abstract": "Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is fast replacing traditional access control models due to its dynamic nature, flexibility and scalability. ABAC is often used in collaborative environments. However, a major hurdle to deploying ABAC is to precisely configure the ABAC policy. In this paper, we present an <i>ABAC mining</i> approach that can automatically discover the appropriate ABAC policy rules. We first show that the ABAC mining problem is equivalent to identifying a set of <i>functional dependencies</i> in relational databases that cover all of the records in a table. We also propose a more efficient algorithm, called ABAC-SRM which discovers the most general policy rules from a set of candidate rules. We experimentally show that ABAC-SRM is accurate and significantly more efficient than the existing state of the art.",

However, commercially viable methods for implementation of ABAC do not exist while a vast majority of organizations use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) or their temporal extensions, such as Temporal Role Based Access Control (TRBAC). In this paper, we present a solution for organizations having a RBAC/TRBAC that can deploy an ABAC policy. Essentially, we propose a method for the translation of an ABAC policy (including time constraints) into a form that can be adopted by an RBAC/TRBAC system. We experimentally demonstrate that time taken to evaluate an access request in RBAC and TRBAC systems is significantly less than that of the corresponding ABAC system. Since the cost of security management is more expensive under RBAC when compared to ABAC, we present an analysis of the different management costs and present mitigation approaches by considering various administrative operations.",

          "abstract": "Access control policies are dynamic in nature, and therefore require frequent updates to synchronize with the latest organizational security requirements. As these updates are handled, it is important that all user access requests be answered contemporaneously and correctly without any interruption or delay. In this paper, considering the context of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), we propose an approach that is capable of immediately materializing any update to the policy and ensuring that it is taken into account for any subsequent access requests. One possibility is to update the policy based on the incoming changes through ABAC policy mining techniques. However, it turns out that no existing mining approach can offer correct enforcement of policies when access requests are entertained during the updates. We provide a formal proof for this surprising result and then propose an approach called <i>δ</i>wOP that does not suffer from this problem. Essentially, <i>δ</i>wOP keeps track of the needed information from updates and uses this in conjunction with the existing ABAC policy rules to make access decisions. We present the complexity analysis as well as a comprehensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for different types of changes.",

However, current solutions assume that the rules are to be mined from a static data set of access permissions and that this process only needs to be done once. However, in real life, access policies are dynamic in nature and may change based on the situation. Simply utilizing the current approaches would necessitate that the mining algorithm be re-executed for every update in the permissions or user/object attributes, which would be significantly inefficient. In this paper, we propose to incrementally maintain ABAC policies by only updating the rules that may be affected due to any change in the underlying access permissions or attributes. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed incremental approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional ABAC mining.",

          "abstract": "Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is increasingly becoming popular due to its dynamic, flexible, portable, and scalable nature. Under ABAC, security policies (ABAC rules) are stated in terms of the attributes of the subject, the object and the environment. A subject is granted access to an object if their respective attribute values are satisfied against a set of ABAC rules. Typically hierarchical relationships exist among the subjects as well as the objects, where more specific subjects (objects) inherit the attributes from the general ones. As such, if a subject is allowed access to a general object, that subject is allowed to access all of its sub-types. This has been the general understanding and current ABAC enforcement and policy mining approaches follow this approach. However, in this article, we argue that the general understanding of the semantics of the ABAC is not always appropriate. Indeed, under certain semantics, the specific data may be more sensitive than that of its general counterpart. In that situation, if a subject is allowed access to a general type, it should not be allowed access to its sub-type, which is contrary to the current understanding and implementation. This article is the first attempt in the literature to distinguish these two different ABAC semantics arising from the different semantics of object attributes themselves. We present concrete examples of these two semantics and demonstrate what can go wrong—both anecdotally as well as empirically—if one ignores the underlying semantics and inappropriately uses the existing enforcement and mining algorithms. We then present how existing algorithms can be modified so that no misconfigurations arise and security is ensured.",

While AI chatbots serve as initial consumer touchpoints, facilitating human-like interactions and enhancing sales, there are concerns about their effectiveness. One prevalent strategy to enhance their effectiveness is anthropomorphism, which involves embedding AI chatbots with human-like features. However, more research needs to be directed toward understanding the potential effects of anthropomorphizing AI chatbots. Design/methodology/approach The key informant approach is used for data collection. Data were collected using a survey instrument via an online panel from consumers who have recently interacted with AI chatbots. Regression-based analyses have been conducted using SPSS, PROCESS Macro and MEDCURVE Macro. Findings The results indicate that anthropomorphism has a significant U-shaped effect on privacy concerns. We also find that personalization and hedonic value moderate the non-linear association between anthropomorphism and privacy concerns. Finally, we find additional support for the mediated effect of anthropomorphism on disclosure intentions via privacy concerns. Originality/value This study raises concerns about excessively anthropomorphizing AI chatbots and marketers’ reliance on them.

We conducted a systematic review of 135 studies examining RAT's application to phishing. Our findings indicate that although RAT is widely prevalent in the literature, it often neglects critical aspects such as detailed victim profiles and underlying factors influencing susceptibility to phishing attacks. To address this gap, we developed a new cybercriminological theory that specifically aims to explain phishing victimization. The proposed Experience-Consequence Theory of Phishing Susceptibility focuses on the understanding of the consequences of clicking on suspicious links and the victims’ prior experiences with phishing. These elements can help security professionals identify better strategies for reducing phishing victimization by tailoring security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs to meet the specific needs of their employees. Furthermore, this theory has managerial implications because it offers organizations a more comprehensive and robust approach to reducing the risk of social engineering and improving the overall security posture.",

Data were collected using six qualitative methods and analyzed using analytic induction and constant comparison. Results/Conclusions : Seven PCTs were relatively effective negotiators, whereas nine PCTs were relatively ineffective. The PCTs’ negotiation skills were influenced by their comfort with physical education, pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge. The negotiations initiated by the PCTs and their students were similar to those described in previous studies. The type and amount of student-initiated negotiation was influenced by their gender, age, skill level, and content taught. The implications for preparing PCTs to teach physical education are discussed.",

This study investigated how the edTPA was integrated and aligned into different physical education teacher education (PETE) programs in New Jersey. It also sought to understand teacher educators’ perceptions and experiences in preparing teacher candidates for the edTPA. Methods : This study utilized three data sources: semistructured interviews ( n = 4), one focus group interview ( n = 1), and documents ( n = 17). Data analysis reflected a conventional approach toward qualitative content analysis. Results : In analyzing the data, four themes were established: (a) benefits and drawbacks of edTPA in PETE, (b) goals and success of edTPA in PETE, (c) integrating edTPA into PETE—macro- and microperspectives, and (d) analytic insights into edTPA and future recommendations. Discussion/Conclusion : In states requiring the edTPA, early exposure, scaffolding, curriculum mapping, and a shared mission and vision are critical. In states not requiring the edTPA, programs may want to consider indicators of performance, such as artifacts, reports, elements of the edTPA, university-based assessments, or a portfolio. Regardless of the type of assessment, “a” performance-based assessment may help to determine teacher candidates’ ability to plan, instruct, assess, and reflect.",

The declining interest in education professions among college students and the resulting deactivation of university PETE programs due to low enrollment necessitate innovative solutions. Current data indicate a significant reduction in the number of students pursuing careers in education, contributing to a shortage of qualified physical education teachers. To address this issue, the proposed program structure offers a tri-track system: one focused on traditional physical education teaching and the other two tracks on athletic coaching and physical activity leadership. Both non-gated tracks are designed to attract a broader range of students by eliminating restrictive entry requirements and providing clear, career-oriented pathways in a variety of fields related to health and physical activity including coaching in private settings (e.g., sports clubs and academies) and community settings (e.g., municipal recreation programs) and leadership in community-based health and physical activity programs. By diversifying career options and removing entry barriers, this innovative structure aims to rejuvenate PETE programs, making them more appealing and accessible to prospective students.",

A survey designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data is distributed among Architecture and Construction Management students at different levels and investigates their perception of the following eight approaches: environmental sustainability, societal sustainability, economic sustainability, energy sustainability, water sustainability, material choice sustainability, zero-emission sustainability, and lean zero-waste sustainability. In addition to providing insight into students' perception of the relative importance of these sustainability approaches, analysis of the survey responses offers key findings on the source of students' sustainability knowledge (work, social media, or higher education), the degree to which students have made decisions about their career paths, and the potential relationship between knowledge gained and students' perception of the impact of sustainable design and construction options. Findings also indicate how perceptions compare between population groups, such as students of architecture and students of construction. In general, students seem to be best equipped in explaining their understanding of the listed options based on their individual experiences.

          "abstract": "A full analysis of Eileen Gray’s approach to architecture and design is now necessary for any thorough presentation and discussion of modern architecture, specifically in architecture history textbooks. This argument is based on three main points. One, Gray’s work was initially omitted from surveys and the modern “canon” because she was a woman. Two, scholarship has reached a turning point in both the attribution of her work and in the discussion of its historical importance. And three, her work provides case studies for student learning that expose key contributions to the discourse on modernity not offered by other architects at the time. While Joseph Rykwert argued for the significance of Gray’s work in 1971, a review of thirteen history of architecture survey texts avail¬able through 2019 shows only six mentioning Eileen Gray or her work. The number implies a largess that doesn’t actually exist. In one case only her last name is given in a footnote. In another two, her name is only included within a list of other names. It’s time to make room for her architecture and design positions in how we talk about modern architecture in our histories, anthologies, surveys and sources: in our textbooks and course readers. What’s at stake is the canon. And it’s time for Eileen Gray.",

International students are consistently positioned as a source of quality by bringing diversity and a variety of worldviews into classrooms. This research aims to investigate enhancing international graduate student recruitment and enrollment processes by analyzing and understanding sample STEM graduate student experiences and satisfaction levels at Kennesaw State University, specifically those of Construction Management graduate students. The experiences examined will focus on academic (educational) and non-academic (support) areas so that recommendations can be made to satisfy those needs better and thereby recruit and retain more international graduate students in STEM programs, such as architecture and construction management. The study will use a survey method to determine international graduate students' experience with essential issues related to academic (educational) and non-academic (support) areas. This research explores several aspects relating to international students' recruitment, such as cultural differences and student needs in terms of accommodation, university support, and recognition. Results will provide several key strategic recommendations to enhance international student recruitment in STEM graduate programs, focusing on Construction Management graduate programs.

In the search for halogen‐free electrolytes, we studied the electronic structure of the current electrolytes using first‐principles theory. The results showed that all current electrolytes are based on superhalogens, i.e., the vertical electron detachment energies of the moieties that make up the negative ions are larger than those of any halogen atom. Realizing that several superhalogens exist that do not contain a single halogen atom, we studied their potential as effective electrolytes by calculating not only the energy needed to remove a Li + ion but also their affinity towards H 2 O. Several halogen‐free electrolytes are identified among which Li(CB 11 H 12 ) is shown to have the greatest potential.",

New classes of molecules referred to as superalkalis and superhalogens exist whose properties resemble those of alkali and halogen atoms, respectively.

Using gradient-corrected density functional theory we have examined the possibility that a new class of salts, referred to as supersalts, could be synthesized with superalkalis and superhalogens as building blocks. The possibility that hyperhalogens can be synthesized by using superalkalis instead of alkali atoms as the core has also been examined. Examples of superalkalis (superhalogens) used in this study include Li3O, Cs2Cl, and Cs2NO3 (BF4, BeF3, and NO3). While supersalts are found to be stable, the ability of superalkalis to form as the core of hyperhalogens is limited due to their large size.",

In this study, an amine-functionalized benzimidazole-linked polymer (BILP-6-NH2) was synthesized by a combination of pre- and postsynthetic modification techniques in two steps. Presynthetic incorporation of nitro groups resulted in stoichiometric functionalization (1 nitro/phenyl) in addition to noninvasive functionalization, where more than 80% of the surface area maintained compared to BILP-6. Experimental studies presented enhanced CO2 uptake and CO2/CH4 selectivity in BILP-6-NH2 compared to BILP-6, which are governed by the synergetic effect of benzimidazole and amine moieties. DFT calculations were used to understand the interaction modes of CO2 with BILP-6-NH2 and confirmed the efficacy of amine groups. Encouraged by the enhanced uptake and selectivity in BILP-6-NH2, we have evaluated its performance in landfill gas separation under vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) settings, which resulted in very promising working capacity and sorbent selection parameters outperforming most of the best solid adsorbent in the literature.",

To validate the accuracy of the DFT-based method, calculations were also performed on small clusters using coupled cluster method with singles and doubles and noniterative inclusion of triples (CCSD(T)).

Since pseudohalogens mimic the chemistry of halogen atoms, our objective is to see if pseudohalogens can also form superhalogens much as halogens do and if the critical size for a doubly charged anion depends upon the ligand. The electron affinities of MCl(n) (M = Na, Mg, Al) exceed the value of Cl for n ≥ (k + 1), where k is the normal valence of the metal atom. However, for M(CN)(n) complexes this is only true when n = k + 1. In addition, while the electron affinities and vertical detachment energies of MCl(n) complexes are close to each other, they are markedly different when Cl is replaced by pseudohalogen, CN. The origin of these anomalous results is found to be due to the large binding energy of cyanogen, (NCCN) molecule. Because of the tendency of CN molecules to dimerize, the ground state geometries of the neutral and anionic M(CN)(n) complexes are very different when their number exceed the normal valence of the metal atom. While our calculations support the conclusion of Skurski and co-workers that pseudohalogens can form the building blocks of superhalogens, we show that there is a limitation on the number of CN moieties where this is true. Equally important, we find large differences between the ground state geometries of the neutral and anionic M(CN)(n) complexes for n ≥ (k + 2) which could play an important role in interpreting future experimental data on M(CN)(n) complexes. This is because the electron affinity defined as the energy difference between the ground states of the anion and neutral can be very different from the adiabatic detachment energy defined as the energy difference between the ground state of the anion and its structurally similar ne",

          "abstract": "Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is a harmful acidic gas generated from power plants and fossil fuel combustion and represents a significant health risk and threat to the environment. Benzimidazole-linked polymers (BILPs) have emerged as a promising class of porous solid adsorbents for toxic gases because of their chemical and thermal stability as well as the chemical nature of the imidazole moiety. The performance of BILPs in SO<sub>2</sub> capture was examined by synergistic experimental and theoretical studies. BILPs exhibit a significantly high SO<sub>2</sub> uptake of up to 8.5 mmol g<sup>-1</sup> at 298 K and 1.0 bar. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that this high SO<sub>2</sub> uptake is due to the dipole-dipole interactions between SO<sub>2</sub> and the functionalized polymer frames through O<sub>2</sub>S(δ<sup>+</sup>)···N(δ<sup>-</sup>)-imine and O═S═O(δ<sup>-</sup>)···H(δ<sup>+</sup>)-aryl and intermolecular attraction between SO<sub>2</sub> molecules (O═S═O(δ<sup>-</sup>)···S(δ<sup>+</sup>)O<sub>2</sub>). Moderate isosteric heats of adsorption (<i>Q</i><sub>st</sub> ≈ 38 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) obtained from experimental SO<sub>2</sub> uptake studies are well supported by the DFT calculations (≈40 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), which suggests physisorption processes enabling rapid adsorbent regeneration for reuse. Repeated adsorption experiments with almost identical SO<sub>2</sub> uptake confirm the easy regeneration and robustness of BILPs. Moreover, BILPs possess very high SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption selectivity at low concentration over carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>): SO<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>, 19-24; SO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>, 118-113; SO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>, 600-674. This study highlights the potential of BILPs in the desulfurization of flue gas or other gas mixtures through capturing trace levels of SO<sub>2</sub>.",

          "abstract": "Atomic clusters with specific size and composition and mimicking the chemistry of elements in the periodic table are commonly known as superatoms. It has been suggested that superatoms could be used to replace elements that are either scarce or expensive. Based on a photoelectron spectroscopy experiment of negatively charged ions, Castleman and co-workers [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 975 (2010)] have recently shown that atoms of Ni, Pd, and Pt which are well known for their catalytic properties, have the same electronic structure as their counterpart isovalent diatomic species, TiO, ZrO, and WC, respectively. Based on this similarity they have suggested that ZrO, for example, could be a replacement catalyst for Pd. Since catalysts are seldom single isolated atoms, one has to demonstrate that clusters of ZrO also have the same electronic structure as same sized Pd clusters. To examine if this is indeed the case, we have calculated the geometries, electronic structure, electron affinity, ionization potential, and hardness of Pdn and (ZrO)n clusters (n = 1-5). We further studied the reaction of these clusters in neutral and charged forms with H2, O2, and CO and found it to be qualitatively different in most cases. These results obtained using density functional theory with hybrid B3LYP functional do not support the view that ZrO clusters can replace Pd as a catalyst.",

          "abstract": "Clusters constitute an intermediate state of matter between molecules and solids whose properties are size dependent and can be tailored. In recent years, cluster science has become one of the most exciting areas of research since their study can not only bridge our understanding between atoms and their bulk but also between various disciplines. In addition, clusters can serve as a source of new materials with uncommon properties. This dissertation deals with an in-depth study of clusters as a bridge across physics, chemistry, and materials science and provides a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationships by focusing on three different topics. The first topic deals with superatoms which are clusters that mimic the chemistry of atoms. I show that superhalogens and superalkalis can be designed to mimic the chemistry of halogen and alkali atoms, respectively. An entirely new class of salts can then be synthesized by using these superatoms as the building blocks. I have also explored the possibility of designing highly electronegative species called hyperhalogens by using superhalogens as ligands or superalkalis as core and a combination of both. Another aspect of my work on superatom is to examine if traditional catalysts (namely Pd) can be replaced by clusters composed of earthabundant elements (namely Zr and O). This is accomplished by comparing the electronic structure and reactivity of Pd clusters with isoelectronic ZrO clusters. The second topic deals with a study of the electronic structure of coinage metal (Cu and Ag) clusters and see if they remain unchanged when a metal atom is replaced by an isoelectronic hydrogen atom as is the case with Au-H clusters. The third topic deals with clusters as model of polymeric materials to understand their gas storage and sequestration properties. This is accomplished by studying the trapping of H2, CO2, CH4 and SO2 molecules in borazine-linked polymers (BLPs) and benzimidazole-linked polymers (BILPs). ",

          "abstract": "Negative ions play an important role in chemistry as building blocks of salts and oxidizing agents. Halogen atoms, due to their ability to attract electrons, readily form negative ions. Considerable interest exists in the design and synthesis of new negative ions called superhaogens whose electron affinities are much higher than those of halogen atoms. This thesis deals with the design of such species. Using density functional theory I have studied two classes of superhalogens. First one involves d1 transition metal (Sc, Y, La) atoms surrounded by Cl while the second one involves simple metals (Na, Mg, Al) surrounded by pseudohalogens such as CN. Geometry, electronic structure, and electron affinity of these species containing up to 5 ligands have been calculated. Studies reveal a fundamental difference between the interaction of transition and metal atoms with electronegative ligands. In addition, pseudohalogens can be used to synthesize a new class of superhalogens.",

          "abstract": "Body temperature monitoring is crucial in helping to decrease the amount and severity of heat illnesses; however, a practical method of monitoring temperature is lacking. In response to the lack of a practical method of monitoring the temperature of athletes, Hothead Technologies developed a device (HOT), which continuously monitors an athlete's fluctuations in body temperature. HOT measures forehead temperature inside helmets. The purpose of this study was to compare HOT against rectal temperature (Trec). Male volunteers (n = 29, age = 23.5 ± 4.5 years, weight = 83.8 ± 10.4 kg, height = 180.1 ± 5.8 cm, body fat = 12.3 ± 4.5%) exercised on a treadmill at an intensity of 60-75% heart rate reserve (HRR) (wet bulb globe temperature [WBGT] = 28.7° C) until Trec reached 38.7° C. The correlation between Trec and HOT was 0.801 (R = 0.64, standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 0.25, p = 0.00). One reason for this relatively high correlation is the microclimate that HOT is monitoring. HOT is not affected by the external climate greatly because of its location in the helmet. Therefore, factors such as evaporation do not alter HOT temperature to a great degree. HOT was compared with Trec in a controlled setting, and the exercise used in this study was moderate aerobic exercise, very unlike that used in football. In a controlled laboratory setting, the relationship between HOT and Trec showed favorable correlations. However, in applied settings, helmets are repeatedly removed and replaced forcing HOT to equilibrate to forehead temperature every time the helmet is replaced. Therefore, future studies are needed to mimic how HOT will be used in field situations.",

Would conflicts in non-Western societies be better handled by the adaptation and adoption of customary, traditional, or localized mechanisms of mitigation? These and similar questions have engaged the attention of scholars and policy-makers.

In large part, such an analysis speaks to the re-mapping of Ancient World relations and the role of anti-colonial historiography in the execution of such a task. Anti-colonial historiography has challenged the presuppositions of the modern political construction of these regions and their interaction. It has done so by posing critical questions concerning the re-reading of existing data and, therefore, the reconstruction of the historical record. The new direction into Nubian/Nabatean relations initiates a broader cultural analysis of the \"Old World\" in the \"Classical Era.\"",

          "abstract": "Modern iechnology creates an imperative for increasingly diverse classroom experiences. Both students and faculty can benefit from the constant technological advances occurring today. Students expect their educational experience to include the use of current technology, multimedia presentations of subject content, and engaging learning interactivity. A dramatic benefit can be achieved by the use of diverse tools, such as a classroom web site, email communication between all classroom participants. and other Internet-based rechnology.

          "abstract": "Current software engineering practices involve modeling as a key activity in the building of efficient and usable software systems. Software development's initial phases include the creation of a complete model of the user group, followed by comprehensive formulation of the task models which comprise the system. These are integrated into the conceptual model, which is evaluated and validated with usability inspection methods. The relationship between building conceptual models and developing systems from these solutions provides a sound basis for industrial-strength software engineering called model-based software engineering (MBSE). This paper illustrates the process of two fundamental, complementary sets of activities from domain engineering and application engineering. Discussions regarding application of traditional engineering principles to known solutions will be compared to the framework of model-based software engineering. A global view of the duality of domain and application engineering is provided with the relevant aspects of the modeling activities.",

          "abstract": "Background: Canadian public safety personnel (PSP; e.g., correctional workers, dispatchers, firefighters, paramedics, police officers) are exposed to potentially traumatic events as a function of their work. Such exposures contribute to the risk of developing clinically significant symptoms related to mental disorders. The current study was designed to provide estimates of mental disorder symptom frequencies and severities for Canadian PSP. Methods: An online survey was made available in English or French from September 2016 to January 2017. The survey assessed current symptoms, and participation was solicited from national PSP agencies and advocacy groups. Estimates were derived using well-validated screening measures. Results: There were 5813 participants (32.5% women) who were grouped into 6 categories (i.e., call center operators/dispatchers, correctional workers, firefighters, municipal/provincial police, paramedics, Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Substantial proportions of participants reported current symptoms consistent with 1 (i.e., 15.1%) or more (i.e., 26.7%) mental disorders based on the screening measures. There were significant differences across PSP categories with respect to proportions screening positive based on each measure. Interpretation: The estimated proportion of PSP reporting current symptom clusters consistent with 1 or more mental disorders appears higher than previously published estimates for the general population; however, direct comparisons are impossible because of methodological differences. The available data suggest that Canadian PSP experience substantial and heterogeneous difficulties with mental health and underscore the need for a rigorous epidemiologic study and category-specific solutions.",

          "abstract": "Substantial media attention has focused on suicide among Canadian Public Safety Personnel (PSP; e.g., correctional workers, dispatchers, firefighters, paramedics, police). The attention has raised significant concerns about the mental health impact of public safety service, as well as interest in the correlates for risk of suicide. There have only been two published studies assessing lifetime suicidal behaviors among Canadian PSP. The current study was designed to assess past-year and lifetime suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts amongst a large diverse sample of Canadian PSP. Estimates of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were derived from self-reported data from a nationally administered online survey. Participants included 5,148 PSP (33.4% women) grouped into six categories (i.e., Call Centre Operators/Dispatchers, Correctional Workers, Firefighters, Municipal/Provincial Police, Paramedics, Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Substantial proportions of participants reported past-year and lifetime suicidal ideation (10.1%, 27.8%), planning (4.1%, 13.3%), or attempts (0.4%, 4.6%). Women reported significantly more lifetime suicidal behaviors than men (ORs = 1.15 to 2.62). Significant differences were identified across PSP categories in reports of past-year and lifetime suicidal behaviors. The proportion of Canadian PSP reporting past-year and lifetime suicidal behaviors was substantial. The estimates for lifetime suicidal behaviors appear consistent with or higher than previously published international PSP estimates, and higher than reports from the general population. Municipal/Provincial Police reported the lowest frequency for past-year and lifetime suicidal behaviors, whereas Correctional Workers and Paramedics reported the highest. The results provide initial evidence that substantial portions of diverse Canadian PSP experience suicidal behaviors, therein warranting additional resources and research.

          "abstract": "Abstract Background Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most widely tested and empirically supported psychological treatments for depression. Beck and other scholars established the theoretical foundations of CBT among North American populations, yet surprisingly few studies have examined central hypotheses of the cognitive model of depression among people living in non-Western regions. Methods In the present study, we used the alignment method to minimize measurement bias to examine several central hypotheses of the cognitive model among adults living on four continents ( n = 752): North America ( n = 103; female = 29.1%), Europe ( n = 404; female = 36.4%), South America ( n = 108; female = 18.5%), and Asia ( n = 136; female = 19.9%). Results Depressive symptoms were positively and strongly correlated with negative automatic thoughts about self (ATQ-N), and moderately associated with dysfunctional attitudes (DAS) among people living on the four continents. Further, use of emotional suppression strategies to regulate emotion (ERQ-Suppression) was moderately and positively associated with depressive symptoms among people on all four continents, while use of cognitive-reappraisal (ERQ-Reappraisal) was not systematically associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions Results of this study offer preliminary cross-continental support for foundational hypotheses of the cognitive model of depression. Negative thoughts appear to be associated with depression in all regions of the world, cementing this construct as a hallmark feature of the disorder.",

Participants in each study were recruited through online crowdsourcing websites and completed study questionnaires. Results from Study 1 suggested that, while rumination did not appear to moderate the relationship between IU and depression, rumination appeared to partially mediates such relationship. Results from Study 2 supported rumination as fully mediating the relationship between IU and depression over two months. The brooding and reflection rumination subtypes exerted a significant indirect, but not moderating, effect on the relationship between IU and depression. Brooding exhibited a stronger mediation effect than did reflection. Overall, current results suggest that high levels of IU fuel the development of depression symptoms over time through engagement in heightened rumination. The IU-depression association appeared fully explained through rumination as it is a passive and contextually-dependent coping response that may enhance individuals' emotion and facilitate the development of depressive symptoms.",

This study examined if protective factors (perceived resilience; mindfulness; grit; self-efficacy) explained variance in problem gambling tendencies (assessed with the Problem Gambling Severity Index) beyond the HEXACO personality traits (honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience) and risk factors for problem gambling (gender; age; socio-economic status; high frequency gambling behaviour; harsh unpredictable childhood environments; sensation-seeking; impulsivity; self-control; stress). This study used a crowdsourced community sample (n = 469) recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Bivariate analyses showed that risk factors and some HEXACO traits (especially honesty-humility) were associated with problem gambling issues. Among protective factors, only trait mindfulness showed a bivariate association with problem gambling issues. Somewhat surprisingly, regression analyses revealed that protective factors did not explain variance in problem gambling beyond HEXACO traits and risk factors. However, in exploratory analyses, mindfulness and self-efficacy – both modifiable protective factors – moderated the relationship between high-frequency gambling (a key proximate antecedent of problem gambling) and problem gambling tendencies. These results suggest mindfulness and self-efficacy may serve as ‘buffers’ against the development of problem gambling issues and may be promising targets for clinical interventions.",

Immunisation theories of resilience suggest that resilience and related factors may buffer against the deleterious effects of early childhood adversity. Trait mindfulness is linked to resilience and may be a pathway to cultivating this dynamic process. In this study, we investigated whether trait mindfulness can buffer against the effects of early childhood maltreatment in predicting lifetime number of months depressed.MethodsWe recruited 43 previously depressed, currently remitted patients, and retrospectively examined their depression history (using a structured interview, LIFE‐SCID (Longitudinal Interval Follow‐Up Evaluation—Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‐IV)), their self‐reported experience of maltreatment in the first 16-years of life (MOPS (Measure of Parental Style)), and their levels of trait mindfulness (MAAS (Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale)).ResultsWe found that number of months depressed in a lifetime was positively associated with reported childhood maltreatment, and negatively associated with trait mindfulness. Second, we found evidence that trait mindfulness significantly moderated the relationship of early childhood maltreatment and number of months depressed. Specifically, it appears that individuals who report severe histories of maltreatment are especially vulnerable to recurrent depression if they are also reporting low levels of trait mindfulness.ConclusionsIncreasing mindfulness may be warranted among individuals reporting a history of childhood abuse with lower baselines of trait mindfulness; however, results of this retrospective study require replication in a larger, prospective trial.",

While hundreds of available interventions are aimed to improve resilience and protect PSPs’ mental health, research evidence regarding intervention effectiveness remains sparse. Methods—Focus groups with PSP elicited a discussion of psychoeducational program content, preferred modes of program delivery, when such training should occur, and to whom it ought to be targeted. Results—The results of thematic analyses suggest that PSP participants feel that contemporary approaches to improving mental health and resilience are lacking. While welcomed, the provision of sporadic one-off mental health and resilience programs by organizations was seen as insufficient, and the available organizational mental health supports were perceived as being questionable. The available programs also left participants feeling insufficiently prepared to deal with personal mental health problems and in discussing mental health concerns with co-workers. Conclusions—Participants reported needing more engaging methods for delivering information, career-long mental health knowledge acquisition, and a systems approach to improve the workplace culture, particularly regarding mental health.",

However, we do not have a good measure of competence in CBT case conceptualization that can be used to guide training and elucidate mechanisms. Aims: The current study addresses this gap by describing the development and preliminary psychometric properties of the Collaborative Case Conceptualization – Rating Scale (CCC-RS; Padesky et al., 2011). The CCC-RS was developed in accordance with the model posited by Kuyken et al. (2009). Method: Data for this study ( N = 40) were derived from a larger trial (Wiles et al., 2013) with adults suffering from resistant depression. Internal consistency and inter-rater reliability were calculated. Further, and as a partial test of the scale's validity, Pearson's correlation coefficients were obtained for scores on the CCC-RS and key scales from the Cognitive Therapy Scale – Revised (CTS-R; Blackburn et al., 2001). Results: The CCC-RS showed excellent internal consistency (α = .94), split-half (.82) and inter-rater reliabilities (ICC =.84). Total scores on the CCC-RS were significantly correlated with scores on the CTS-R ( r = .54, p &lt; .01). Moreover, the Collaboration subscale of the CCC-RS was significantly correlated ( r = .44) with its counterpart of the CTS-R in a theoretically predictable manner. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that the CCC-RS is a reliable measure with adequate face, content and convergent validity. Further research is needed to replicate and extend the current findings to other facets of validity.",

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) hold promise, but likely require adaptation to make them culturally relevant for Indigenous peoples. We sought to gather Indigenous students’ perspectives on the consistency and adaptability of MBIs for Indigenous students experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Method This three-part longitudinal investigation employed a qualitative design mixed with Indigenous research methods to elicit feedback from students ( n = 14; M age = 28.92) on the acceptability of MBIs and ways to tailor MBIs to make them more consistent with Indigenous cultures and student lifestyles. We subsequently used this feedback to develop an outline for an adapted MBI that was then re-evaluated by the same participants for its cultural relevance and safety. Results Indigenous students emphasized the need for the adapted MBI to incorporate (a) traditional Indigenous practices; (b) Indigenous facilitators; (c) holistic conceptualizations of mental health that include spirituality; and (d) practices and methods that could improve flexibility and accessibility of the adapted intervention. Based on this feedback, we presented students with an outline of an adapted MBI tentatively titled Miyowâyâwin Mindful Wellbeing Program , which received favorable evaluations by students for cultural consistency and safety. Conclusions We confirmed the perceived acceptability and consistency of mindfulness and mindfulness programs with Indigenous cultures. The need for a flexible MBI that centers Indigenous elements and Indigenous facilitators was highlighted by Indigenous participants. This study paves the way for latter steps of the development and subsequent evaluation of the Miyowâyâwin Mindful Wellbeing Program . Preregistration This study is not preregistered.",

Personal relative deprivation (PRD) involves appraising oneself as unfairly disadvantaged relative to similar others and has been associated with poorer mental health and negative cognitive appraisals. As generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with negative cognitive appraisals, PRD may relate to the experience of GAD and its cognitive predictors, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive beliefs about worry (PBW), negative beliefs about worry (NBW), and experiential avoidance (EA). Method: In two observational studies (Study 1, N = 588; Study 2, N = 301) participants completed measures of PRD, cognitive predictors and symptoms of GAD, subjective socioeconomic status (SES), self-efficacy, and self-esteem. Results: A relationship between PRD and GAD was found across studies, which was simultaneously mediated by IU and NBW. These results remained when controlling for subjective SES but were weakened when controlling for self-concept factors. Discussion: This research supports the possibility that the experience of deprivation may “trap” people in thinking patterns that contribute to anxious symptomology.",

Dispositional mindfulness (DM) and self-compassion (SC) have consistently been associated with psychological disorder symptoms and appear to buffer the effects of stress on depression and anxiety. Methods Across two studies ( n = 888), we examined direct and indirect (moderation) relationships of DM, SC, COVID-19-related stress, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. We also examined the differential effects of several DM measures (FFMQ-15; FFMQ-39; MAAS) in the relationships of COVID-19 stress and psychological disorder symptoms. We recruited participants (Study 1 n = 350; 42.2% cis women; Study 2 n = 538; 44.3% cis women) online (MTurk) and examined associations of DM, SC, and COVID-19 stress, and emotional impact, and the moderating effect of DM and SC in the relationships of COVID-19-related fears, stress, emotional impacts, and psychological disorder symptoms. Results DM and SC were moderately and negatively correlated with COVID-19 fears and stress (correlations ranging r = − .14 to r = − .42) across studies. Study 1 moderation analyses demonstrated SC, but not DM (FFMQ-15), significantly moderated relationships of COVID-19 fears and emotional impacts with symptoms. Study 2 analyses demonstrated the FFMQ-39, but not the MAAS, significantly moderated relationships of COVID-19 stress and psychological disorder symptoms. Conclusions These results support the potential protective roles of DM and SC in disrupting pathological trajectories related to naturally elevated pandemic stress. Results also demonstrate the differential associations of several DM measures with COVID-19 stress. Future research should replicate such findings with more diverse samples and using various measures of self-compassion and risk metrics.",

          "abstract": "Public safety personnel (PSP) face frequent stressors that increase their risk of developing symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition to being exposed to potentially traumatic events, PSP trainees may face a compounded risk of developing mental health symptoms, as their training environments are conducive to social comparisons and the resultant painful emotion of envy. Envy is associated with numerous negative health and occupational outcomes. Fortunately, there are several individual difference factors associated with increased emotional regulation, and such factors may offer resilience against the damaging mental health effects of envy. In this study, we examined the interplay between dispositional mindfulness, self-compassion, and dispositional envy in predicting job satisfaction, stress, experience of positive and negative emotions, subjective resilience, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a sample of police trainees (n = 104). A substantial minority of trainees reported clinically significant symptoms of depression (n = 19:18.3%) and anxiety (n = 24:23.1%) in accordance with the cut-off scores on screening measures. Consistent with hypotheses, dispositional envy was associated with lower job satisfaction, greater stress, and greater anxiety and depression. Furthermore, envy was associated with higher negative emotions, lower positive emotions, and lower subjective resilience. Dispositional mindfulness and self-compassion were associated with greater job satisfaction, lower stress, and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moreover, mindfulness and self-compassion were both associated with lower negative emotions, higher positive emotions, and subjective resilience. The associations between envy and the relevant job and mental health outcomes were significantly diminished after controlling for mindfulness and self-compassion. This suggests that these protective traits may serve as transdiagnostic buffers to the effects of envy on mental healt",

          "abstract": "Abstract Background Public safety personnel (PSP; e.g., border services personnel, correctional workers, firefighters, paramedics, police, public safety communicators) are frequently exposed to potentially psychologically traumatic events. Such events contribute to substantial and growing challenges from posttraumatic stress injuries (PTSIs), including but not limited to posttraumatic stress disorder. Methods The current protocol paper describes the PSP PTSI Study (i.e., design, measures, materials, hypotheses, planned analyses, expected implications, and limitations), which was originally designed to evaluate an evidence-informed, proactive system of mental health assessment and training among Royal Canadian Mounted Police for delivery among diverse PSP (i.e., firefighters, municipal police, paramedics, public safety communicators). Specifically, the PSP PTSI Study will: (1) adapt, implement, and assess the impact of a system for ongoing (i.e., annual, monthly, daily) evidence-based assessments; (2) evaluate associations between demographic variables and PTSI; (3) longitudinally assess individual differences associated with PTSI; and, (4) assess the impact of providing diverse PSP with a tailored version of the Emotional Resilience Skills Training originally developed for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in mitigating PTSIs based on the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders. Participants are assessed pre- and post-training, and then at a follow-up 1-year after training. The assessments include clinical interviews, self-report surveys including brief daily and monthly assessments, and daily biometric data. The current protocol paper also describes participant recruitment and developments to date. Discussion The PSP PTSI Study is an opportunity to implement, test, and improve a set of evidence-based tools and training as part of an evidence-informed solution to protect PSP mental health. The current protocol paper provides details",

This literature also points to possible differences in symptom reporting patterns between men and women. Using data from a larger dataset (Beshai et al. 2016), the current study examined whether non-depressed and depressed Egyptian and Canadian men and women differed in their self-report of the various domains of the Beck Depression Inventory –II (BDI-II). Method We recruited a total of 131 depressed and non-depressed participants from both Egypt ( n = 29 depressed; n = 29 non-depressed) and Canada ( n = 35 depressed; n = 38 non-depressed). Depression status was ascertained using a structured interview. All participants were asked to complete the BDI-II along with other self-report measures of depression. BDI-II items were divided into two subscales in accordance with Dozois, Dobson &amp; Ahnberg (1998) factor analysis: cognitive-affective and somatic-vegetative subscales. Results We found a significant three-way interaction effect on the cognitive-affective ( F (1,121) = 9.51, p = .003) and main effect of depression status on somatic-vegetative subscales ( F (1,121) = 42.80, p &lt; .001). Post hoc analyses revealed that depressed Egyptian men reported lower scores on the cognitive-affective subscale of the BDI-II compared to their depressed Canadian male counterparts. Conclusions These results suggest that males across cultures may differentially report cognitive symptoms of depression. These results also suggest that clinicians and clinical scientists need to further examine the interaction effect of culture and gender when investigating self-reported symptoms of depression.",

Perceived stress can be reliably linked with physiological responses, such as increased heart rate. Even though dispositional mindfulness is associated with lower self‐reported stress, no studies to date have examined whether dispositional mindfulness can predict physiological responses to and recovery from stress. We recruited 142 student participants and administered a measure of dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire—Short Form/FFMQ‐SF) and a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Specifically, during the TSST, we instructed participants that they were about to deliver a presentation to a panel of judges, then informed them they no longer need to deliver this presentation, all while measuring their heart rate. We found that total FFMQ‐SF and non‐reactivity subscale scores were positively and significantly correlated with heart rate reactivity to the lab stressor. Further, we found that the FFMQ‐SF facet of non‐judgment was negatively and significantly correlated with the time it took for participants' heart rates to return to and stabilize at baseline. The results of this study elucidate potential mechanisms of mindfulness in stress. Specifically, mindfulness may not necessarily make people less reactive to stressors, but may operate through top‐down processes to enhance recovery and resilience during stress.",

Despite knowing the landscape, academic neophytes are required to navigate the social and political rungs, negotiate participation on university, college, and department committees, develop and/or enhance their research niche, and demonstrate uncompromising proficiency as a teacher, mentor, supervisor and advisor. This paper explores strategies and principles that were adopted by one department within a teacher preparation program to establish a mentoring program for new and/or early career special education faculty. A major assumption we put forth in this paper is that faculty mentoring is no longer an academic frill in academe, but rather a necessary way in which we build and foster high quality teacher preparation within a complex field.",

Reducing modeling by the teacher and increasing modeling by other students may lead to greater reading fluency and overall reading achievement and satisfaction.

The mission of our mentoring program was envisaged as providing visible and consistent support for new and early career faculty development. The program that was established was conceived as a reciprocal learning relationship characterized by trust, respect, and commitment in which a mentor would support the professional and personal development of another by sharing his or her life experiences, influence, and expertise.

Exploring how data can be collected, utilized, and rendered useful in the education arena is of utmost importance to those most closely involved in research aimed at improving educational practice and/or cultural responsibility. This chapter focuses on how privileging a culturally responsive epistemology through conducting research using visual methodologies (i.e., participant-generated drawings, photo-elicitation, film, etc.) in educational contexts can elevate cultural responsibility overall in educational research contexts. We first present our assertion that the boundaries of educational research have been redrawn by visual methodologies. Next, we deconstruct the concept of culturally responsible research by examining the significance of its precursors, culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive pedagogy, and feminist theory that undergird our perspective and frame the chapter. Lastly, studies utilizing visual research methodologies are analyzed for their relevance to culturally responsive, vis-à-vis, responsible research and the epistemology that privileges their application.",

A modified thematic analysis of narratives from a cross-sectional survey revealed eight themes: Sense of loss/grief, Role conflict, Helplessness, I had no choice, This felt impossible, Lost connections, Am I safe, and They don’t care about me. Sub-themes expound on their associated themes. Participant narratives shared feelings of trauma and crisis as they related experiences of higher education during the mandated global shutdown. The stories of these experiences are indicative of loss of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, tenets of self-determination. These experiences, for the majority of students, led to a loss of motivation to learn, participate, or produce meaningful work. For most instructors, the experiences led to a similar lassitude and frustration. The authors conclude that the experience of the ETRE negatively impacted both teaching and learning in the higher education setting. Recommendations include further development in higher education to support both instructors’ and students’ self-determination during catastrophic change.",

State-funded colleges and universities in Georgia were mandated to do the same in April of 2020, which led to a system-wide hiatus in face-to-face instruction while instructors prepared to return to all-remote teaching. This study examined the effects of this transition to Emergency Remote Instruction (ERI) at six institutions in Georgia, using a survey completed by 910 instructors who made that transition in at least one course in the Spring term of 2020. 65% of the instructors taught remotely or online for the first time after the transition. Instructors reported accessing a variety of institutional, collegial, and internet resources to aid in the transition, leading 53.4% of them to express that they were adequately prepared for ERI. Once classes resumed online, instructors found themselves to be needing much more time for remote instruction than their previous F2F instruction. From a one-word summary description of their experience, instructors reported that it led them to be challenged, stressed, overwhelmed, and exhausted.",

This technique uses the brain signals to make decisions, control and communicate with the world using brain integration with peripheral devices and systems. In this paper, in order to classify imaginary motions, raw data are used to train a system of neural networks with a majority vote output. EEG data for 3 subjects are used from the BCI Competition III dataset V. Each subject has data collected in three sessions representing three different types of imaginary motions. Using an optimized set of electrodes, classification accuracy was optimized for the three users as a group. A cross validation method is applied to improve the reliability of the generated results. The optimization resulted in an electrode structure consisting of 15 electrodes with a relatively high classification accuracy of almost 80%.",

Apart from this, the various factors of improvements needed to make commercial remote surgery successful have been discussed in detail. This paper focuses first on the various operational concepts behind remote or robotic surgery. In this paper, a detail study of the structure and design of the robotic hand has been provided. However, this technology is still in its nascent stage and needs considerable improvement to be made commercial. Attention has been drawn to research about bio compatible materials which will not react with the body and cause harm. The final aspect of robot surgery that has been discussed in this paper is the wireless communication between the remote stations. Attention has been drawn to the points of improvement in the communications infrastructure. It was concluded in the paper that although the idea of remote surgery has been conceived long ago, not much work has been done on improving the precision of the robotic system, bio compatibility of the robotic arm and the communications infrastructure of the system to make it commercially feasible.",

The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of SF thickness variation on different EIM parameters and propose a parameter which is least affected and also can detect muscle conditions. We analyzed four different parameters in this study for various SF thicknesses and none of them possesses constant profile with alteration in SF thickness. For example, resistance in normal condition varies 24.48% with per millimeter SF thickness variation while phase varies 4.01%. Further investigation shows that among the observed parameters percentage changes in reactance is minimum with fat thickness variation while effectively identifying different muscle conditions.",

This is also crucial in designing better AI algorithms and finding favored scenarios for joint AI-human missions that capitalize on the unique capabilities of both elements. In this conceptual study, we introduce Intentional Behavioral Synchrony (IBS) as a synchronization mechanism between humans and AI to set up a trusting relationship without compromising mission goals. IBS aims to create a sense of similarity between AI decisions and human expectations, drawing on psychological concepts that can be integrated into AI algorithms. We also discuss the potential of using multimodal fusion to set up a feedback loop between the two partners. Our aim with this work is to start a research trend centered on exploring innovative ways of deploying synchrony between teams of non-human members.

An important application of this technology is to help facilitate the lives of the tetraplegic through assimilating human brain impulses and converting them into mechanical motion. However, BCI systems are remarkably challenging to implement as recorded brain signals can be unreliable and vary in pattern throughout time. In this paper, a novel classifier structure is proposed to classify different types of imaginary motions (left hand, right hand, and imagination of words starting with the same letter) across multiple sessions using an optimized set of electrodes for each user. The proposed technique uses raw brain signals obtained utilizing 32 electrodes and classifies the imaginary motions using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). To enhance the classification rate and optimize the set of electrodes of each subject, a majority voting system combining a set of simple ANNs is used. This electrode optimization technique achieved classification accuracies of 69.83%, 94.04% and 84.56% respectively for the three subjects considered in this study.",

Passenger-driver behavior from psychological processes can provide insight into the trust levels of the dyad dynamic during an open-road drive. Measuring passenger trust can benefit in speeding up the adoption of self-driving cars. This area has not been fully explored from the passenger's point of view and can yield results that could potentially propel the progress of driver safety systems in autonomous driving. A novel approach to correlating the passenger-driver trust levels can be elicited from brain-based indicators that are extracted from time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that capture both sensory and cognitive processes. In this paper, we propose a trust identification technique utilizing evoked response potential (ERP) events such as P300 along with beta/alpha frequency ratios from specific passengers during braking, aggressive acceleration, and lane changing scenarios. The results obtained from the decomposition of these EEG signals into the frequency bands and application of machine learning techniques on data collected from frontal and parietal electrodes during these driving events prove the feasibility of this study. By examining additional passenger-driver pairs with varying social interaction and trust profiles in the future, we can strengthen the existence of a cognitive correlation between passenger-driver behavior and thus improve the efficiency of driver safety systems.",

It is a fact that as technology becomes more ubiquitous, we become more dependent on its integration into our daily routines, including driving tasks. With the integration of technology and cars, drivers can become easily distracted with the bombardment of secondary tasks such as cell phone usage, navigation systems, listening to podcasts, etc. We analyzed the cognitive correlations between distracted driving behavior based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals using conversation with co-passengers as a secondary driving task and a linear support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Results indicated that EEG features may provide a salient feature set for detecting driver distraction behavior. Furthermore, when compared with previous classification methods, the accuracy rating improved by 5% using SVM classification. Therefore, from these preliminary results, we posit that cognitive data can be used as a valid feature for classifying distracted driver behaviors. Future studies will further validate this result. The authors suggest, however, that a combination of EEG data with physiological features using SVM classification may provide a more robust system with improved performance accuracy.",

In this technique, a virtual world is developed which replicates the real world and helps researchers to collect data from subjects to understand various human driving behavior. In this paper, lateral variation characteristics (speed variance and lane positioning) are monitored on a virtual highway, to help understand the cause of innumerous accidents on US highways due to failure of lane maintenance. Data was collected from five healthy subjects in two sessions where each driver had to perform two different tasks. The result implies that any secondary task along with driving distracts the driver to some extent and involves risk on the road. This study will quantify the extent to which secondary driving tasks impact primary task. The mental workload of the drivers are also determined in order to understand the mental demand of driving on the simulator.",

Subjects are instructed to drive in a highway scenario with three co-passengers in the car and also alone, while changing lanes whenever possible. Eye glance of the driver is observed for 90 seconds for each scenario and the compared result implies that driving with co passengers increased eye glance rapidly. An overall average frequency of 0.1145 is obtained based on the number of times a subject actually changed lanes and number of glances in 90 seconds in both scenarios. Based on this frequency, an algorithm is designed to predict driver's intention to change lanes.",

WBAN is a network utilized for continuous monitoring of physiological state of the subject, where the patient can perform his regular activities while his body parameters get measured continuously and are accessed by the physician remotely. This chapter provides a thorough survey of current WBAN technologies in the healthcare sector. Besides the recording of physiological parameters, discussions have been provided on remote data transmission to a server called Virtual Doctor Server (VDS). During this transmission, WBAN network uses various technologies namely Ultra Wide Band WBAN, Technology Enabled Medical Precision Observation 3.1 (TEMPO 3.1), J2ME and Bluetooth. Details of several existing WBAN related projects have been discussed along with their applications. The next section of the chapter deals with the use and design of medical sensors in WBAN. Performance comparison between WBAN and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) has also been provided.",

A survey says that alone Spotify releases about ten thousand songs a month. At the same time, users developed a taste of listening to music of different languages. Hence, it is very crucial to maintain a data base that can automatically classify songs of any language based on their genres. This project attempts to utilize a deep learning convolutional neural network technique to identify the genre of a song from twelve different languages all over the world. This project utilized a data base of sixty songs and mainly classified them into three genres: metal, hip hop, and pop. Each song is trimmed to be exactly five seconds long, and each five second \"slice\" is converted into a spectrogram, a visual representation of a song's spectrum in the time domain. These spectrograms are divided into training and testing dataset. 75% of the data set is used for training and 25% is used for testing. A tensor flow deep learning convolutional neural network is used as an image classifier to automatically segregate the songs according to their genres. This deep learning model achieved a classification accuracy of 93.3% for all of the twelve languages considered in this database.",

The survival rate is one of the top concerns of patients following a diagnosis. Current methods are to find survival rates using traditional statistical approaches by examining people of similar conditions. This study is one of a handful that looked at forecasting breast cancer survival time using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Using data from 4024 patients from the NIH SEER program and a Random Forest classifier, we were able to estimate breast cancer survival time within a two-year window with up to 72% accuracy. It was also discovered that the patient's age, race, and marital status are all strongly associated with anticipated survival time. This study is a step toward broader use of ML science in clinic-generated data processing, ultimately improving current practices and opening new avenues for challenging medical research problems.",

Motor Imagery (MI), the paradigm of interest herein, has received extensive attention in application-oriented studies; however, fewer researchers have been interested in its signal characteristics and how they relate to resting-state EEG signals. This study provides an early investigation into this topic and highlights the potential use of rest EEG signals to offer a more practical approach for applying the MI paradigm outside lab settings. A publicly available dataset for 20 subjects was used in this study. First, we developed a classification pipeline consisting of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to verify the legitimacy of the dataset. This model achieved an average of 88% accuracy across the subjects, which deemed the dataset suitable for further work. Then, using the signals' Power Spectral Density (PSD) both at rest and during MI tasks, for both the alpha and beta rhythms, all 20 subjects have shown a positive strong and medium Pearson correlation between rest and MI states. And lastly, we finish the paper by addressing the best strategy moving forward in integrating the obtained results into the body of existing MI-EEG research.",

These fatalities can be mitigated by incorporating driver state information with current Driver Safety Systems (DSS). There are primarily two driver cognitive states: Focused and Distracted. These states can be predicted using Machine Learning algorithms (ML) such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using extracted biomedical features like Electroencephalography (EEG), Electromyography (EMG), Heart Rate and Eye Tracking. This literature review summarizes all biomedical signals that are used in the assessment of driver cognitive states. A thorough literature review in this field identifies eye tracking as the most efficient and quick technique of real time driver state identification. Hence, this paper outlines the latest techniques in eye tracking using oculometry. This review paper also highlights unique ocular feature extraction techniques that can be extremely useful for future researches conducted in the field of driver state recognition.",

          "abstract": "Using Electroencephalography (EEG) to detect imaginary motions from brain waves, is a very nascent and challenging field that started developing rapidly in the past few decades. EEG involves having some electrodes attached on the scalp of the patient to capture the brain signals generated through the patients thought process and record them in a computer. This technique of human and computer interfacing is called Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Disability is a serious problem of our nation and hence BCI can play an important role in facilitating the lives of people who are incapable of communicating due to spinal cord injuries. This technique uses the brain signals to make decisions, control objects and communicate with the world using brain integration with peripheral devices and systems. This requires some intelligence to classify these motions. Neural network have been used as a mean to classify motions, however, the accuracy of classification for certain motions was limited. The novelty of the proposed approach is in using a majority vote system for a network of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that is used to optimally classify imaginary motions performed by individual or multiple subjects. Three kinds of imaginary motions were classified which are imaginary left hand movement, imaginary right hand movement, and imagination of words starting with the same letter. Using an optimized set of electrodes, classification accuracy was optimized for the three users as a group and also individually. The optimization procedure was based on the ranking of the electrodes according to their 2 classification accuracy, electrodes with the lowest accuracies were eliminated to achieve the optimal accuracy. The group optimization of 3 subjects altogether resulted in an electrode structure consisting of 15 electrodes with a relatively high classification accuracy of almost 80%. The individual optimization for each subject resulted in structure of 20 electrodes for subject 1 and ",

They can capture data on where drivers are looking during primary and secondary driving tasks, which can be important for identifying driver intentions and roadway distractions. In this study the eye-glance and head movement of a driver performing a lane-merge task in a driving simulator is observed. Drivers were given a multitask driving scenario while performing lane-change and highway merging maneuvers. Multiple raters were used to assess the reliability of using eye-glance and head motion data for analyzing driver performance. The inter-rater reliability method was used to obtain a driver profile. The purpose of this study is to provide an analytical framework for assessing an elderly (65+) driver's performance during lane-change and highway merging multitask maneuvers using the video capture method. This work contributes to the discovery of knowledge and deeper insight about how a driver's behavior and physical state may directly influence their driving performance and profile.",

However, current research is mostly driver-centered, and very little is known about the passenger. In this study, the authors investigated passenger posture in an attempt to understand their behavior during specific driving events. From this work, the authors present here a method for the analysis of passenger sitting postures and the resulting interactions of the passenger body with the car seat. First, pressure sensors were placed on the bottom and back of the passenger’s seat for collecting the pressure values of the passenger when the car was moving. Second, a real road driving experiment was designed where the passenger and driver were engaged in normal conversation while data were being collected. During the drive, four driving events were recorded: lane change (both in right and left directions), aggressive acceleration, and braking. Passenger motion was used as a metric for predicting the four events via a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In this study, the authors demonstrated the validity of the approach and how the team was able to achieve an average accuracy above 90% for five different drives carried out by different individuals.",

Using the characteristic work–family integration of family business settings as a backdrop we develop theoretical arguments that emphasize the reconciliatory role of interdisciplinary perspectives to explain the ostensibly contradictory findings in extant research. The diminishing barriers separating work and life spheres occurring in most global industries illustrate the importance of conceiving the study of work–life phenomena through recursive, rather than linear, logics and emphasizing the relevance of family business research in providing a contextual foundation for interdisciplinary discussions. Design/methodology/approach This theoretical paper integrates perspectives from the literatures on organizational behavior and family systems theory to form six propositions on the relationship between work–life integration and the antecedents and consequences of burnout and psychological detachment. Findings This paper explores the nuances that overlapping work and family roles might be a source of both harmony and discord in family firms. In doing so, our research contributes to the growing relationship between family systems theory and family business research, and creates the foundation for future empirical studies on the psychological dynamics that underlie work–family integration. Originality/value This research advances a novel perspective on the interactions between work–family integration and burnout and detachment, and does so by noting that the way the family business literature treats work–family integration may apply to any employee that experiences tension between these different spheres of their identity.",

Specifically, in a series of four studies, we address how consumer political ideology influences intentions toward items displaying smaller, inconspicuous logos versus larger, conspicuous logos for unfamiliar and familiar brands. We show that liberal consumers are more likely to prefer a large (rather than small) logo when a brand is unfamiliar. We suggest that liberals’ greater desire for product uniqueness elevates their risk propensity, which in turn increases preference for conspicuous consumption when familiarity with a brand is low. We show that this effect occurs only for unfamiliar brands; when brand familiarity is high (i.e. a popular or well-known brand), consumer political ideology reverses consumer preference for conspicuous consumption, replicating prior work. Our results suggest that, by manipulating their logo size, new brands may effectively target consumers based on their political ideology.",

With the limited research on third-party food delivery, we explore the important questions of (1) where customers place blame in the case of service failures with third-party food delivery (i.e. the platform or the restaurant) and (2) does this depend on the type of service failure? Drawing on blame attribution theory, signaling theory, and an exploratory study, we demonstrate that customers typically perceive such mishaps to be the responsibility of the restaurant rather than the delivery platform itself. We also examine the effect of visible service failure preventative actions taken by the restaurant on blame attribution and re-order intention. Design/methodology/approach We conducted two online scenario-based studies to explore customer blame attribution in the case of third-party food delivery service failure. First, an exploratory study approach (N Study1 = 512 ) was taken to provide additional support for the hypothesis development. An experiment (N Study2 = 252 ) was then conducted to examine the hypothesized effects. Findings First, the results of an exploratory study demonstrate that customers attribute service failures such as wrong items, missing items, cold food, or leaking containers to restaurants over third-party food delivery platforms. Second, the results of an experimental study suggest inclusion of an observable cue indicating preventative action, such as time-stamp information indicating when an order was received and packaged for delivery, increases customer re-order intention through the underlying mechanism of blame attribution. Originality/value We contribute to the underexplored area of third-party food delivery service failure and to our understanding of blame attribution in service failure scenarios. Further, we demonstrate a practical method to shift the blame away from restaurants for ",

While some organizations encourage donors to share WOM that focuses on their own donations (donor-focused WOM; e.g., “I just donated to the kids of @StJude. Join me in saving children's lives.”), others prompt donors to share WOM that focuses on the organization itself (charity-focused WOM; e.g., “Smile Train gives children with clefts the #PowerOfASmile.”). Contrary to the common belief that people mostly want to talk about themselves, the current research demonstrates that donor-focused WOM backfires, such that donors are less likely to share donor- than charity-focused WOM. This effect is driven by their belief that donor-focused WOM is less altruistic and is therefore less efficacious in persuading others to contribute to the same cause. In addition to sharing, the type of WOM solicited exerts far-reaching impact, with donor-focused WOM attracting fewer new donors than charity-focused WOM. The current research improves the understanding of WOM type, its effect, and the underlying processes.",

          "abstract": "Abstract The present work investigates a commonly used but heretofore unexamined donation appeal: a misfortune‐involving appeal. Misfortune‐involving appeals (e.g., dunk tanks, pie tosses) invite consumers to donate to inflict misfortune on others. The process via which such appeals operate remains unknown and guidelines for their effective design are nonexistent. We propose that misfortune‐involving appeals that invite consumers to inflict mild misfortune on deserving targets enable consumers to deliver interpersonal justice, thus eliciting schadenfreude. In turn, schadenfreude increases donation amounts. Six studies demonstrate such increases, establishing the mediating role of schadenfreude, addressing alternative explanations (e.g., licensing and sadism), and identifying boundary conditions. Theoretically, our work is the first to question a common prior assumption: that schadenfreude only occurs when consumers passively observe misfortune. Instead, we show that schadenfreude also emerges when consumers actively inflict misfortune. This finding refines the distinction between schadenfreude and sadism; we show that this distinction relies not on consumers' active/passive role, but on misfortune severity. Our findings expand the understanding of schadenfreude's role in the marketplace, opening the door for future research.",

          "abstract": "Over the course of the last few years, there has been an increase in the number of brands that are using their platforms to raise awareness for and support social justice causes/initiatives, such as gender equality in sports, Black Lives Matter, and #MeToo. Cause-related marketing (CRM), the broader terminology under which this practice falls under, has been the primary subject of prior research projects. Westberg (2004) suggests that consumers respond more favorably to CRM initiatives compared to sponsorship and sales promotion, and that there is some support that CRM initiatives help in increasing consumer attitudes of a brand. Other prior research suggests that organizations in the sports environment would benefit greatly in both consumer perception and purchase intention from CRM (Roy et al. 2003) and that there are differences in responses to CRM initiatives among different demographic segments (i.e. males and females; Nelson et al. 2017). Furthermore, other research suggests that a consumer’s identification with a CRM campaign can increase purchase intention related to a brand and that a brand’s fit with a specific cause has a significant relationship with purchase intention (e Silva et al. 2019). The prior literature presents the theme that consumer perceptions and purchase intention following a CRM campaign have a positive correlation, and that consumers will respond more favorably to those brand initiatives that they personally support. The current research shows that CRM initiatives by popular brands can lead to increases in purchase intention, loyalty, and awareness for that particular brand, which can have the positive outcome of increased sales for the organization. Therefore, this lends to the notion, under the concept of corporate social responsibility, that brands should seek to increase initiatives of this kind not only for the benefit of society and customers, but also for the benefit of the brand as a whole. We conducted a study to test the effect",

The current research demonstrates that visual messaging cues associated with lower perceived movement lead to greater brand loyalty relative to more dynamic cues in response to brand failure. Across five studies, we show that lower perceived movement in visual messaging cues leads to more favorable consumer outcomes (e.g., subsequent real choice behavior and brand loyalty intentions). This effect is mediated by brand trust. Furthermore, we examine theoretically and practically relevant boundary conditions. The findings presented offer theoretical contributions to research on visual communication cues in brand recovery contexts. Additionally, the current research provides managerially relevant insights for communication strategies during recovery.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on self-perception theory, this research finds that redeeming loyalty points, rather than saving them and paying with money, increases return intentions to service establishments. The positive effect of paying with loyalty points is driven by increased satisfaction. Furthermore, this effect is moderated by the offer of bonus incentives, such that the positive effect is attenuated when consumers forgo a bonus offer in exchange for saving points. Two studies confirm these effects. Study 1 demonstrates that redeeming points leads to higher satisfaction, which drives increased return intentions. Study 2 shows that bonus incentives can diminish these benefits, as consumers who forgo a bonus experience reactance, leading to lower satisfaction. The findings highlight the dual impact of loyalty program design: point redemption fosters loyalty, but poorly designed bonus incentives can unintentionally counteract these benefits. For practitioners, the results suggest encouraging point redemption to maximize satisfaction and loyalty. However, caution is warranted, as bonuses may undermine program effectiveness if not redeemed. This research enhances understanding of the dynamics of loyalty programs and payment methods, offering practical insights for boosting loyalty.",

At its height, Covid-19 caused restaurants to shut down and forced businesses to move to a more mobile and delivery-friendly plan. Now, venues for concerts, large events, and sports have started to offer the option of mobile ordering food to be delivered directly to your seat. Mobile ordering has made the food service industry even more accessible; however, it has also brought to light the issue of tipping. Traditionally, tipping was only done at full-service restaurants. Now, businesses like Starbucks, Mcdonald's, and DoorDash ask you to tip before you have received the food when you mobile order. This paper examines the relationship between the platform consumers use to order and consumer return intentions. It also examines whether tip amount and tip likelihood have moderating effects.",

Intercorrelation plays an important but overlooked role in determining outcomes of matching mechanisms. We employ simulation techniques to quantify the effects of intercorrelated preferences on men's and women's aggregate satisfaction with the outcome of the Gale–Shapley matching mechanism. Our results show that even a small amount of positive intercorrelation in a matching market means increased satisfaction for women and dramatically decreased potential for strategic manipulation. Negative intercorrelation has the opposite effects. Thus, matching markets characterized by positive intercorrelation are well suited for matching via Gale–Shapley, while markets characterized by negative intercorrelation may face opposition from the nonproposing side of the market. So that our results are immediately applicable, we also define and employ a general measure of intercorrelation that can be used for any matching market.",

We then turn to simulation experiments to further describe how changes in basic characteristics of agents’ preferences can increase or decrease the efficiency of stable matchings. Our results have important implications for those who seek to improve the functioning of real-world matching markets. Though it may be difficult or even impossible to completely ascertain preferences in a real-world market, it is possible to get a sense of general levels of correlation and intercorrelation from an empirical sample. Our results can then be of help to market designers, letting them know how substantial the price of stability is likely to be.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how preference correlation and intercorrelation combine to influence the length of a decentralized matching market's path to stability. In simulated experiments, marriage markets with various preference specifications begin at an arbitrary matching of couples and proceed toward stability via the random mechanism proposed by Roth and Vande Vate (1990). The results of these experiments reveal that fundamental preference characteristics are critical in predicting how long the market will take to reach a stable matching. In particular, intercorrelation and correlation are shown to have an exponential impact on the number of blocking pairs that must be randomly satisfied before stability is attained. The magnitude of the impact is dramatically different, however, depending on whether preferences are positively or negatively intercorrelated.",

          "abstract": "Take the fort, then take the city. In a two-stage, two-party contest, victory in the initial stage can provide an advantage in the final stage. We examine such momentum in conflict scenarios and investigate how valuable it must be to avoid a Pyrrhic victory. Our main finding is that although the elasticity of effort—which we allow to vary between the two stages—does impact the contestants’ effort levels, it has no bearing on the endogenously determined value of momentum itself. Further, rent dissipation in the two-stage conflict is equal across party whether or not an individual obtains first-stage momentum. Thus, momentum helps a player solely by enhancing marginal ability for victory in the second-stage contest. It does not, however, change the player’s net calculus of second-stage contest spending. Such contestable advantage is also found to be more rent-dissipative than innate/uncontestable advantage. Therefore, Pyrrhic victories should be more common for contests with an intermediate stage or stages in which advantages can be earned, ceteris paribus. While intermediate targets appear as useful conflict benchmarks, they dissipate additional expected contest rents. This additional rent-dissipative toll exists even for backward-inductive equilibrium behavior in a complete information setting. Whereas the quagmire theory suggests parties can become involved in problematic conflicts due to incomplete information, the present paper finds that the setting of conflict—namely, contestable intermediate advantage—can alternatively generate rent-dissipative tolls. Similarly, contestable advantage can lead parties to optimally forego contest participation (i.e., if conflict parameters do not meet the participation constraint). This is in contrast to a one-stage simultaneous contest with second-stage parametric values of the present contest.",

The WMW test is a primary nonparametric statistical test in FDA drug product evaluation and other prominent medical settings. Using computational nonparametric statistical methods, we also establish the relative frequency with which paradox-generating Simpson Reversals occur under RSS when an initial data sequence is pooled with its ordinal replicate. For each 2-sample, n-element per sample or 2 x n case of RSS considered, strict Reversals occurred for between 0% and 1.74% of data poolings across the whole sample space, roughly similar to that observed for 2 x 2 x 2 contingency tables and considerably less than that observed for path models . The Reversal rate conditional on observed initial sequence is highly variable. Despite a mode at 0%, this rate exceeds 20% for some initial sequences. Our empirical application identifies clusters of Simpson Reversal susceptibility for publicly-released mobile phone radiofrequency exposure data. Simpson Reversals under RSS are not simply a theoretical concern but can reverse nonparametric or parametric biostatistical results even in vitally important public health settings. Conceptually, Paradox incidence can be viewed as a robustness check on a given WMW statistical test result. When an instance of Paradox occurs, results constituting this instance are found to be data-scale dependent. Given that the rate of Reversal can vary substantially by initial sequence, the practice of calculating this rate conditional on observed initial sequence represents a potentially important robustness check upon a result.",

          "abstract": "Agents on the same side of a two-sided matching market (such as the marriage or labor market) compete with each other by making self-enhancing investments to improve their worth in the eyes of potential partners. Because these expenditures generally occur prior to matching, this activity has come to be known in recent literature (Peters, 2007) as pre-marital investment. This paper builds on that literature by considering the case of sequential pre-marital investment, analyzing a matching game in which one side of the market invests first, followed by the other. Interpreting the first group of agents as workers and the other group as firms, the paper provides a new perspective on the incentive structure that is inherent in labor markets. It also demonstrates that a positive rate of unemployment can exist even in the absence of matching frictions. Policy implications follow, as the prevailing set of equilibria can be altered by restricting entry into the workforce, providing unemployment insurance, or subsidizing pre-marital investment.",

The instructional methods included an interactive approach using the HPS method, compared with traditional classroom lecture. Results of this study suggest that use of a teaching strategy involving the HPS method made a positive difference in the nursing students' ability to answer questions on a test of cognitive skills. Confidence levels were not found to be significantly enhanced by use of the HPS method.",

The data from the study support the significance of providing mentorship to novice or new nurse educators. The data suggest that mentors benefit from participation in a mentor-protégé program as much as the protégés.

Historically, schools of nursing and hospital-based continuing education departments offered refresher courses in the traditional classroom-based environments. Nurses in less populated/ geographically dispersed areas have limited access to these educational opportunities. Refresher courses, whether in an academic or a hospital-based setting/ are expensive and depend on class size to be cost-effective. An answer to the problem of cost and access is collaborative distance education using web-based instruction.",

          "abstract": "Abstract Nurse Educators must develop nursing curriculum with engaging learning strategies that promote the knowledge and confidence needed for safe, effective nursing practice. Faculty should explore new methods of teaching that consider how students learn. Studies have shown mixed results regarding student learning styles, academic achievement, and development of confidence in nursing practice. An experimental study using Felder and Soloman’s (2004). Index of learning styles instrument was conducted to examine nursing student learning styles and their impact on confidence and knowledge in traditional and high fidelity simulation settings. Findings revealed students were more likely to have active, visual, sensing, and sequential learning styles. Student confidence or knowledge did not significantly differ among the learning styles in either simulation or traditional classroom methods. Awareness of learning styles may aid faculty in adapting engaging teaching strategies. Further research is needed with larger samples to identify best approaches to enhance student learning within the context of learning styles.",

One of five NLGNs are leaving the profession due to work dissatisfaction and feelings of inadequacy, risking patient safety. Method: A prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of a 6-week digital intervention (text messaging) on NLGNs' self-reported stress, resiliency, sense of support, and intention to leave their jobs, organization, and profession. Messages to the experimental group ( n = 10) conveyed emotional, esteem, and networking support, and messages to the control group ( n = 11) were medical facts. Results: The digital intervention in the form of medical facts increased the control group's sense of social support. Stress, resilience, and intention to leave their jobs, organizations, or profession did not change for either the control or experimental group. Conclusion: A digital intervention, such as text messaging, potentially can increase NLGNs' sense of support during their first year of hire. [ J Contin Educ Nurs . 2021;52(8):367–374.]",

This article evaluates an educational project to assess the impact of a repeat septic shock simulation on pre-licensure nursing students' knowledge and skill competency. Methods: A quasi-experimental, repeated measures, pre-post design strategy was used to evaluate a repeat septic shock simulation. A convenience sample of one-hundred-forty-three (N = 143) senior baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the study. The project consisted of a septic shock didactic session, septic shock simulation with a high-fidelity mannequin, debrief, repeat simulation followed by a second debrief as a component of a complex health nursing course. Ninety-seven (n = 97) participants were randomly assigned to groups of up to five students to participate in a repeat septic shock simulation. Forty-six (n = 46) participants were randomly assigned to up to five students and served as a control group. The control group participated in all study elements except the repeat simulation.Results: The percent change in nursing students’ knowledge scores from Pre-simulation to Post-simulation was statistically significant (p &lt; .001). The initial and repeat simulation realized modest gains in competency scores between the initial and repeated simulation.Conclusions: Providing concurrent experiences using a screening tool in real-time while simultaneously providing an opportunity to practice and refine clinical judgment through a repeat simulation proved effective.",

To understand the havoc wreaked, a little background information would be helpful. Let us start with the different forms of physician compensation, which generally breaks down into three groups: fee for service (catch it while you can), discounted fees for service (rapidly rising in popularity), and capitation (still on the increase, but having problems). Fee-for-service medicine is, of course, the preferred form of physician reimbursement and is the only form of payment generally used by physicians who practice cosmetic surgery exclusively. However, most members of the American Academy of Facial Plastic Reconstructive Surgery and/or American Association of Head Neck Surgeons, in addition to cosmetic surgery, also practice, to varying degrees, a broad spectrum of head and neck surgery. Because these services are frequently compensated",

The owner who leases the building using a triple net lease does the upgrade prior to leasing the building, with the expectation of earning higher rents. How much should the owner who leases the property spend for a given rent per square foot increase? Design/methodology/approach – The empirical study highlights the impact of key financial variables on the dependent variable medical office construction spending put in place in the USA. The independent variables prime interest rate, cost of natural gas per therm and electricity cost per KWH, resale building prices are significant variables when predicting medical office construction spending. A case study using a cost-benefit model is developed. It inputs corporate income tax rates, incorporates a debt service coverage ratio, prime interest rate, analyzes investment tax credit (ITC) and rebate scenarios and varies the level of rental income and energy savings. The case study results provide insight into which factors are enabling higher net construction spending when considering a green energy retrofit project. Both the regression model and the case study model focussed on the owner of a building who rents medical office space to tenants using a triple net lease. The owner/lessor paradigm analyzes revenue enhancements, the tax implications of having these savings and benefits associated with borrowing when financing the green retrofit. The availability of low cost borrowing, increases in the ITC percent and rebates and increases in rent per square foot have an impact on potential energy upgrade spending. Findings – The empirical model finds the independent variables to be significant. Utility cost, resale value of office buildings, the prime interest rate, business bankruptcy court filings and unemployment rate fluctuations adequately explain moveme",

          "abstract": "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to address the apparent slow acceptance on the part of developers located in the USA to seek green certifications. If green-certified construction costs more than non-green construction, then is there a financial reason for not seeking a green rating. Do green buildings perform better than non-green buildings financially? The paper develops and presents a discounted present value model for doing a cost-benefit analysis for building green. This model enables an investor to determine the feasibility of constructing a new green-certified building instead of a conventional non-green building. Non-green buildings are not certified by a rating agency such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Energy Star or Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM). Real estate permits are granted by local municipalities in the USA. This means that local government mandates requiring green construction that significantly adds to the initial cost of a project could have the unintended result of encouraging new non-green construction just outside their municipal boundaries. Design/methodology/approach – The paper collects publically available research data for office buildings located in the USA, and inputs this information into an income statement. It tests the hypothesis: is green-certified construction a financially feasible choice for an investor? An incremental approach using a 15-year holding period is presented. This time period takes into account equipment wear and tear. Heating/cooling systems and other green-technologically based operating systems have a limited life and do not last for 30 or 40 years. They are likely to need replacement after 15 years have lapsed. Findings – The negative net present value (NPV) results and high payback periods indicate that increased rents for green construction, a tax credit for the present value loss and/or property-tax reduction covering the shortfall is n",

          "abstract": "The activation of <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is triggered by the closure of bilobed (D1 and D2) clamshell-like clefts upon binding glycine (Gly) and glutamate. There is evidence that cholinergic compounds modulate NMDAR-mediated currents via direct receptor-ligand interactions; however, molecular bases are unknown. Here, we first propose a mechanistic structure-based explanation for the observed ACh-induced submaximal potentiation of NMDA-elicited currents in striatal neurons by predicting competitive inhibition with Gly. Then, the model was validated, in principle, by confirming that the coapplication of Gly and ACh significantly reduces these neuronal currents. Finally, we delineate the interplay of ACh with the NMDAR by a combination of computational strategies. Crystallographic ACh-bound complexes were studied, revealing a similar ACh binding environment on the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR. We illustrate how ACh can occupy X-ray monomeric open, dimeric \"semiopen\" cleft conformations obtained by molecular dynamics and a full-active cryo-EM NMDAR structure, explaining the suboptimal NMDAR electrophysiological activity under the \"Venus Flytrap model\". At an evolutionary biology level, the binding mode of ACh coincides with that of the homologous ornithine-bound periplasmic LAO binding protein complex. Our computed results indicate an analogous mechanism of action, inasmuch as ACh may stabilize the GluN1 subunit \"semiclosed\" conformations by inducing direct and indirect D1-to-D2 interdomain bonds. Additionally, an alternative binding site was detected, shared by the known NMDAR allosteric modulators. Experimental and computed results strongly suggest that ACh acts as a Gly-competitive, submaximal potentiating agent of the NMDAR, possibly constituting a novel chemotype for multitarget-directed drug development, e.g., to treat Alzheimer's, and it may lead to a new understanding of glutamatergic neurotransmission.",

The permitting process was eased by the city in 2014. The city’s enforcement of occupancy and rental ordinances, sometimes called Airbnb laws, were tightened in 2019. The new code restrictions are tighter than the rental codes that existed previously. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses time-series data to first consider the thesis that relaxing building permit requirements for tiny homes has encouraged legal construction and increased the number of applications filed with the city planning office. The number of permits was the dependent variable and time-sensitive dummy variable was the independent variable. An adjusted T -statistic was calculated using a least-squares regression model with a moving average autocorrelation adjustment. The second regression model considers the financial relationship between active listings on Airbnb and HomeAway to a housing price coverage ratio and the aggregated dynamic-factor model used to calculate the economic activity index for Portland. Findings There were two reported case study findings. The first regression used a dummy variable measuring the application response to permit easing. It was positive and significant. The second finding measures active host listings on Airbnb whether they are directly associated with the calculated multiple of the changes in the S&amp;P/Case–Shiller housing price index low tier divided by weekly employee income. Higher numbers for this coverage ratio suggest that listings on short-term rental platforms are increasing directly with the ratio. The economic activity index is insignificant when predicting the level of listings. Regression results indicate that property owners are financially motivated to list dwellings as visitor rentals and possibly motivated to install tiny homes behind their primary residences as short-ter",

          "abstract": "Purpose San Francisco started regulating short-term vacation rentals on rooms/apartments/houses located within city limits in September 2019. The objectives of this conceptual-scenario and regression study are to calculate the present value of the net earnings for a short-term residential rental property located in San Francisco pre-regulation and post-regulation, and consider a financial reason motivating households to list properties as short-term rentals. Design/methodology/approach A present value approach is used to estimate the value of rental space to tourists prior to the passage of San Francisco's short-term rental regulations compared to post-rental rules. Table 2 shows pre- and post-income scenarios. Price increases of +20, +40 and +60 percent over the initial base rate failed to restore host earnings to pre-registration levels. The present value model calculates the net revenue less net cost associated with listing a property. The regression model uses the number of listings as the dependent variable, and housing prices divided by weekly wages as independent variables. Findings The short-term rental regulations significantly reduce the profitability associated with short-term tourist stays offered by hosts and listed by online platforms. A host earns pre-regulation income when average daily rents increase by approximately 71.5 percent. It will likely limit income earned by hosts and Airbnb and other shared housing website platforms due to the reduced number of rental days allowed for shared housing caused by ordinances and host enrollment restrictions. The regression model results suggest that homeowners were listing properties for rent to help cover higher priced property purchases.

Because federal guidelines for the WIC program leave little maneuvering room to improve the delivery of services, we analyzed the client flow through a WIC clinic in the Atlanta metropolitan area to determine how that flow could be managed more efficiently. The challenge facing the WIC clinic was to increase the efficiency of their operation in an environment characterized by resource constraints, rigid regulations, and dysfunctional client behavior. In a limited physical space, the WIC clinic was expected to provide a number of sequential services to a client population that failed to arrive or arrived late 40 percent-50 percent of the time. The provision of services was further complicated by walk-ins, which were not only common but, according to federal guidelines, also must be accommodated. To analyze the clinic's problem, we used the General Purpose Simulation System for personal computer (GPSS/PC) to simulate client flow through the clinic. Estimates of the average amount of time a client spent in the clinic as well as average waiting times at each station and clerk and nurse utilization rates were generated assuming a variety of staffing levels. For comparison purposes, each version of the model was run with a 20-minute time lag before a late appointment was filled, and then a one-minute lag. The data used for the simulation were collected by clinic personnel during February 1994. It included the number of clerks and nurses available; the waiting time to see clerks and nurses for walk-ins and appointments; the waiting time to get WIC vouchers; the number of appointments met; the number of appointments missed; and the total time in the clinic for walk-ins and appointments.

Practical implications Establishes that financial distress comes from several sources, not just home damage. Financial distress is highly correlated with whether a home was insured.

Existing office space potentially has an economic life of 25 to 40 years. It may be operating inefficiently compared to newer buildings for many years. Designing a market-based incentive system that encourages periodic remodeling which lowers energy usage and carbon emissions would have social benefits. Design/methodology/approach An owner/user case study is developed to test financial feasibility. The empirical study uses publicly available information to examine whether the variables modeled react as anticipated. The regression model incorporates variables of importance to an owner/user. Tax credits and energy deductions, interest rates associated with borrowing and likely electricity and natural gas rate changes are independent variables used to predict the dependent variable new non-residential private construction spending. Findings Investment tax credits (ITCs) coupled with lending has a positive impact on new non-residential commercial construction spending. The value of these benefits is not sufficient to encourage total building energy retrofits, but would encourage low-cost system upgrades. The interest rates associated with borrowing and the debt-service coverage ratio need to be kept low for existing building energy retrofits to be stimulated. Practical implications The case study provides a template that a business can use to determine the financial feasibility of a proposed energy upgrade. It enables the comparison of the marginal cost associated with an update to the present value of the financial benefits likely to be generated. Local real estate tax reductions linked to specific energy upgrades offered by many municipalities can be added to the expected energy savings generated by doing the retrofit.

Unrepaired flooded dwellings are subsequently being foreclosed with mortgage-insurance claims being paid to lenders. This paper aims to examine if weather events that cause flooding impact the losses suffered by mortgage insurers and homeowners. Design/methodology/approach Two fully modified least squares regression models are done using losses experienced by two mortgage insurance companies. The AM Best insurance rating information for a 16-year period or years 2002–2017 is used to study whether the loss ratios experienced by two companies underwriting private mortgage insurance (PMI) are statistically correlated to National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claim levels. The assumption is that higher flood insurance claims are a proxy for more severe weather events during a particular year which results in flooding that damage residences. Findings The NFIP claims coefficient is positive and significant for both companies being examined. This indicates that the more serious the flooding event during a specific year, the higher the losses experienced by the private mortgage insurer. The R 2 results for the regression models were 0.673–0.695. The income variable has a negative coefficient which was significant. It indicates that falling income lead to rising mortgage insurer losses. The NFIP variable was significant with a positive coefficient.

Homeowners in the United States and in much of Europe can purchase flood insurance. The Netherlands and Asian countries generally do not offer flood insurance protection to homeowners. Uninsured households incur the entire cost of repairing/replacing properties damaged due to flooding. Homeowners’ policies do not cover damage caused by flooding. The paper examines the link between personal bankruptcy and the severity of flooding events, property prices and financial condition levels. Design/methodology/approach A fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) regression model is developed which uses personal bankruptcy filings as its dependent variable during the years 2000 through 2018. This time-series model considers the association between personal bankruptcy court filings and costly, widespread flooding events. Independent variables were selected that potentially act as mitigating factors reducing bankruptcy filings. Findings The FMOLS regression results found a significant, positive association between flooding events and the total number of personal bankruptcy filings. Higher flooding costs were associated with higher bankruptcy filings. The Home Price Index is inversely related to the bankruptcy dependent variable. The R -squared results indicate that 0.65% of the movement in the dependent variable personal bankruptcy filings is explained by the severity of a flooding event and other independent variables. Research limitations/implications The severity of the flooding event is measured using dollar losses incurred by the National Flood Insurance program.

The ratios are measuring the risk associated with house price stability. They may signal whether a real estate investor should consider purchasing real property, continue holding it or consider selling it. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (Dallas Fed) calculates and publishes income ratios for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries to measure “irrational exuberance,” which is a measure of housing price risk for a given country's housing market. The USA is a member of the organization. The income ratio idea is being repurposed to act as a buy/sell signal for real estate investors. Design/methodology/approach The income ratio calculated by the Dallas Fed and this case study's ratio were date-stamped and graphed to determine whether the 2006–2008 housing “bubble and burst” could be visually detected. An ordinary least squares regression with the data transformed into logs and a regression with structural data breaks for the years 1990 through 2019 were modeled using the independent variables income ratio, rent ratio and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The descriptive statistics show a gradual increase in the ratios prior to exposure to an unexpected, exogenous financial shock, which took several months to grow and collapse. The regression analysis with breaks indicates that the income ratio can predict changes in housing prices using a lead of 2 months. Findings The gradual increases in the ratios with predetermine limits set by the real estate investor may trigger a sell decision when a specified rate is reached for the ratios even when housing prices are still rising. The independent variables were significant, but the rent ratio had the correct sign only with the regression with time breaks model was used. The housing spike using the Dallas Fed's incom",

Are higher incomes, lower mortgage rates and green income-tax credits impacting housing price changes? Design/methodology/approach The paper uses the least-squares regression model with natural log specifications. The log of income and a dummy variable, which was assigned to the Energy Policy Act (2005) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) coverage dates are used as independent variables. Two regression models were examined using monthly housing price data from January 1990 through the year 2018. The first regression model used a single dummy variable for credits available under the Policy Act of 2005 and the Recovery Act of 2009. The second regression model considered the credits granted under these two laws separately. Disposable income per capita impacts demands for housing while green upgrade expenditures affect the cost of housing. Findings The laws set low credit limits of $500 followed by $1,500 but because of the multiplier effect, the spending appears to have magnified and been much higher. The credit availability variables have positive coefficients and were significant at 1 per cent. This implies that single-family housing prices were sensitive to the existence of residential energy property income-tax credits. The R 2 results were 0.93 or above for both models. Research limitations/implications The data used was aggregated and publicly available online. Many studies use aggregated macroeconomic data when modeling housing prices using the exogenous variable of disposable income but there is no substitute for examining individual homes by location and their sales price to see under what conditions green income-tax credits have the most impact.

A cost-benefit model is developed that inputs several personal income tax rates, incorporates a debt-service coverage ratio, analyzes investment tax credit and rebate scenarios and varies the level of energy savings. The cost-benefit case study results provide insight into which factors enable higher net construction spending when considering a green energy retrofit project. Both the regression model and the case study model focused on the tenant who rents medical office space using a triple net lease.  The tenant paradigm limits the analysis to energy savings, the tax implications of having these savings and benefits associated with borrowing when financing the green retrofit. The availability of low cost borrowing and increased investment tax credit (ITC) rates increases net retrofit construction spending.",

Two reaction paths are described that produce silyl (SiH3) and hydrogen atom fragments adsorbed on the dimer dangling bonds. The energy barrier on the lowest energy path is 12–14 kcal/mol (depending on the details of the theoretical method used), while the barrier on the other path is about 17 kcal/mol. The initial step in both mechanisms is abstraction of a hydrogen atom from silane by an electron-deficient surface atom. It is also possible for the surface to react by forming a bond between the more electron-rich surface atom and the silane Si atom. This latter reaction path has a prohibitively high barrier (39 kcal/mol), and it leads to different products (adsorbed SiH2 and elimination of H2). These results are discussed in the context of Si film growth kinetics, ultrahigh vacuum studies of silane adsorption and other theoretical studies of silicon surface chemistry.",

Adsorption of HOCl on ice is a prototype of a simple ice surface reaction, and it has been the subject of several laboratory studies, making this a valuable case for testing theoretical approaches to ice surface reactions. The present paper describes a first-principles theoretical study of HOCl adsorption on ice, applying density functional theory (DFT) to cluster models of the (0001) surface of ice Ih. In the most stable binding configurations, HOCl acts as a proton donor in a hydrogen bond. The strength of HOCl binding on the surface depends not only on the hydrogen bonding interaction but also on electrostatic and many-body interactions with neighboring water molecules. The results of these DFT calculations are compared to post-Hartree−Fock calculations of the H2O−HOCl complex and to empirical potential simulations of HOCl on ice.",

These species are intermediates in the growth of silicon films by chemical vapor deposition of silane and disilane. The lowest-energy trihydride species is metastable with respect to the lowest-energy dihydride species, but two surface dangling bonds must be available to affect the transformation to the dihydride. In the lowest-energy configurations, dimers either have both dangling bonds occupied or both unoccupied. While the energy difference between isomers with fully occupied and partially occupied dimers will strongly favor fully occupied dimers at low temperatures, there will be a distribution of dimer occupations at high temperatures. The structures and energies of some other local minima corresponding to tri- and dihydrides are also described. While these species are energetically unfavorable and should only exist transiently, they illustrate the relative energetics of some alternative bonding behavior of the silicon surface.",

An analytic model is developed to describe the distribution of CO between step and terrace sites in the equilibrium limit, and refine our previous determination of the binding energy difference between these sites to ΔEs-t=0.6±0.2 kcal/mol. Time-resolved surface infrared measurements indicate that the equilibrium step coverage is reached within 100 ms of the chemisorption event. This rapid migration across the (100) terraces to step sites implies a barrier to surface hopping of &amp;lt;5.5 kcal/mol. On a longer time scale of minutes, the CO population at step sites increases further as the equilibrium point is shifted by the dissociative adsorption of residual hydrogen. These slower step filling rates are described with a kinetic model, in which hydrogen adsorption is the rate-limiting step.",

However, studies indicate that nursing students often exhibit negative attitudes toward older adults. This study aimed to determine if a three-phased educational intervention significantly improved nursing students’ attitudes toward older adults. A pre/post-test study design was used to measure the change in nursing students’ attitudes toward older adults, as measured by the UCLA Geriatrics Attitudes Survey, after participating in an Artificial Intelligence in Education learning event (n = 151). Results indicate that post-intervention scores (M = 35.07, SD = 5.34) increased from pre-intervention scores (M = 34.50, SD = 4.86). This difference was statistically significant at the 0.10 significance level (t = 1.88, p = 0.06). Incorporating artificial intelligence technology in a learning event is an effective educational strategy due to its convenience, repetition, and measurable learning outcomes. Improved attitudes toward older adults are foundational for delivering competent care to a rapidly growing aging population.

Method and results Soil bacterial community composition was obtained by amplifying, sequencing, and analysing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess the effects of tillage, CC, and time on bacterial community response. The most abundant phyla present were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. Bacterial diversity increased in periods with abundant water. Reduced tillage (RT) increased overall bacterial diversity, but NT with a CC was not significantly different than RT treatments under drought conditions. CCs shifted abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes depending on abiotic conditions. Conclusions In the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), USA, NT practices lower diversity and influence long-term community changes while cover crops enact a seasonal response to environmental conditions. NT and RT management affect soil bacterial communities differently than found in other regions of the country.",

However, the stability of amikacin within these solutions is unknown. Hypothesis/Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the stability of amikacin at 10 and 30 mg/mL concentrations in four topical solutions over a 56 day period. We hypothesised that amikacin would maintain chemical stability within the various solutions. Methods and materials Amikacin was formulated to 10 and 30 mg/mL (1% and 3%) concentrations within four topical solutions: tris‐EDTA (TrizEDTA Aqueous Flush) (TE); 0.15% chlorhexidine gluconate and tris‐EDTA (TrizCHLOR Flush) (TC); 0.9% NaCl (NA); and 0.9% NaCl + 2 mg/mL dexamethasone (ND). Samples were made in duplicate and stored at room temperature (25°C) for 0, 7,14, 21, 28 and 56 days. Amikacin content was quantified, in triplicate, by ultrahigh‐performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results The recovered amikacin concentrations for the 10 mg/mL solutions ranged from 10 to 13.5 mg/mL (mean 11.5 mg/mL) with the exception of NA sample 2 at Day (D)0 (9.4 mg/mL) and D7 (9.2 mg/mL). The recovered amikacin concentrations for the 30 mg/mL solutions ranged from 30 to 40.2 mg/mL (mean 35.7 mg/mL). No significant difference was seen between the amikacin concentrations at D0 compared to D56 for all solutions except 10 mg/mL TE ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions and clinical relevance Amikacin maintained stability within TE, TC, NA and ND over 56 days except when formulated at 10 mg/mL within TE.",

However, studies reveal negative attitudes among nursing students toward older adults. A three-phased educational intervention that included an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven virtual simulation was implemented to address this. AI-generated simulations promise to expose marginalized groups and strengthen future nurses’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Methods: A convergent mixed-method design was used to measure the change in nursing students’ attitudes toward older adults, as measured by the UCLA Geriatrics Attitudes Survey and a Guided Reflection survey after participating in an Artificial Intelligence in Education learning event (n = 151). Results: The results indicate that post-intervention scores (M = 35.07, SD = 5.34) increased from pre-intervention scores (M = 34.50, SD = 4.86). This difference was statistically significant at the 0.10 significance level (t = 1.88, p = 0.06). The qualitative analysis indicated that the attitudes impacted were challenging and overcoming ageism, increased empathy and patience, and enhanced communication skills.

Summary We included problem list data for patients who had at least 2 face-to-face encounters at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or its clinics between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used the frequency of problem list additions, resolutions, deletions, duplicate problems (exact and SNOMED CT duplicates), inconsistencies (contradicting stages of disease state), and items that could be documented elsewhere in the electronic health record as surrogate markers of problem list maintenance. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results. A total of 546,510 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 3,762 (0.7%) patients who had the exact same active problem listed more than once. SNOMED CT code duplications occurred in the records for 56,399 (10.5%) patients. Of the patients with asthma, 2.5% (223/8,779) had contradicting asthma stages active on their problem list, and 6.4% (950/14,950) of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had contradicting CKD stages. In addition, 17,205 (3.1%) patients had 20,365 active family history problems and 39,464 (7.2%) patients had an allergy documented on their problem list. On average, there were 43.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14-73.4) additions, 8.7 (95% CI, 0.1-17.4) resolutions, and 2.1 (95% CI, 0-4.6) deletions of problems per 100 face-to-face encounters, inpatient or outpatient. Conclusion Our study suggests areas for improvement for problem list maintenance. Further studies into semantic duplication and clinical decision support tools to encourage problem list maintenance and deduplication are needed.",

Such a monitoring scenario is commonly referred to as a “Multiple Stream Process (MSP).” Traditional MSP charting techniques rely on the assumption of normality, which may or may not be met in practice. Thus, a cumulative summation nonparametric MSP control charting technique, based on a modification of the classical extended median test was developed and is referred to as the “Nonparametric Extended Median Test Cumulative Summation (NEMT-CUSUM) chart.” Chart development, including calculation of control limits, is given. Through simulation, the NEMT-CUSUM is shown to perform consistently in the presence of normal and non-normal data. Moreover, it is shown to perform more optimally than parametric alternatives in certain circumstances. Results suggest the NEMT-CUSUM may be an attractive alternative to existing parametric MSP monitoring techniques in the case when distributional assumptions about the underlying monitored process cannot reasonably be made.",

In the present study, the effect between team wins and frequency of pitcher injuries is assessed over the 2009-2019 regular seasons (a total of n = 2,584 pitcher injuries were analysed). The study further aimed to determine if changes in pitcher performance, as quantified by changes in common pitching statistics, including strikeout and walk percentage, can predict whether a pitcher, who has already incurred an IL stint, will require a second IL stint over the same time period. Results suggest that while only a weak relationship exists between team wins and frequency of pitcher injuries, that a decrease in strikeout percentage for a pitcher returning from the IL is associated with an increased likelihood of a second IL stint. Future research should take into consideration a player's value or contribution to their team's success when assessing the effect injuries have on team performance as well as the type of injury sustained.",

Few studies have examined the accuracy of Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) estimates of creatinine clearance (CrCl) compared with measured clearance in these patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between C-G estimates of CrCl and measured CrCl in hospitalized elderly patients. Methods: This Institutional Review Board–approved, single-center retrospective observational cohort study included all patients who were 65 years and older admitted to our medical center in January to September 2018 with either an 8- or 24-hour urine collected during admission. The primary outcome was correlation, bias, and precision of C-G estimates of CrCl versus measured CrCl using Pearson correlation, Spearman linear regression, and Bland-Altman analysis. Outliers were determined using a cut-off of ±20%. Data are presented as median (interquartile range) or percentages. Results: A total of 108 urine collections from 90 unique patients were included in the study. The patients were 51% female, median age was 71 (68-77) years, and median body mass index was 26.6 (22.8-31) kg/m 2 . Most collections were over 24 hours (66.7%), and 38% were performed while patients were in an intensive care unit. Median blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 24.5 (17-36) mg/dL and median serum creatinine was 0.71 (0.55-1.09) mg/dL. The median C-G estimation was 75.4 (48.2-110.6) mL/min, and the median measured CrCl was 79.1 (38.1-99.5) mL/min, r 2 = .56 ( P &lt; .001). Bland-Altman analysis showed large limits of agreement (-75.5-57.7 mL/min), with a bias of −8.9 and precision (standard deviation of bias) of 34 mL/min. Outliers were common, with 38% of C-G estimation values &gt;120% of measured CrCl, and 18% of C-G estimates &lt;80% of measured CrCl. Conclusions: Measured CrCl varied significantly from C-G estimates in hospitalized elderly patients. It is important to recognize characteristics",

However, there is a lack of consensus on the best way to develop students' cultural competence. Although evidence supports short-term study abroad, few studies have used a mixed-methods theory-driven design. Method This convergent mixed-methods study measured the change in cultural competence among baccalaureate nursing (BSN) degree students enrolled in an immersive study abroad program. Quantitative data from the instrument were analyzed to compare pre- and postexperience cultural competence scores. Reflective journal transcriptions were analyzed using deductive content analysis. Results Results showed a statistically significant improvement in postexperience scores compared with preexperience scores. Major themes included embracing diversity, transformative journeys, emotional engagement, cross-cultural experiences, and joyful appreciation. Conclusion This study emphasizes the effectiveness of theory-designed study abroad in enhancing BSN students' cultural competence and analyzes the effects on the individual theoretical constructs of cultural competence.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in performance between ESL students and ENS students in the introductory level statistics course, STAT150, at the University of Norther Colorado (UNC). Due to the dichotomous nature of the data and the large differences in sample sizes between ESN and ESL students, the Bootstrapped Logistic Regression model is used to analyze the data. Contrary to the findings of previously conducted studies, the results of this study suggest that ESL students who have been enrolled in STAT 150 at UNC are just as likely to receive a high mark in the course as their ENS counterparts. One explanation for this finding is that the level of instruction and quality of content provided throughout the course gave all students, including ESL students, all the information necessary to succeed in the course. If this explanation is accepted, the outcomecentric results found by this study reflect well upon the overall quality of instruction and English proficiency policies at UNC.",

This article evaluates an educational project to assess the impact of a repeat septic shock simulation on pre-licensure nursing students' knowledge and skill competency. Methods: A quasi-experimental, repeated measures, pre-post design strategy was used to evaluate a repeat septic shock simulation. A convenience sample of one-hundred-forty-three (N = 143) senior baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the study. The project consisted of a septic shock didactic session, septic shock simulation with a high-fidelity mannequin, debrief, repeat simulation followed by a second debrief as a component of a complex health nursing course. Ninety-seven (n = 97) participants were randomly assigned to groups of up to five students to participate in a repeat septic shock simulation. Forty-six (n = 46) participants were randomly assigned to up to five students and served as a control group. The control group participated in all study elements except the repeat simulation.Results: The percent change in nursing students’ knowledge scores from Pre-simulation to Post-simulation was statistically significant (p &lt; .001). The initial and repeat simulation realized modest gains in competency scores between the initial and repeated simulation.Conclusions: Providing concurrent experiences using a screening tool in real-time while simultaneously providing an opportunity to practice and refine clinical judgment through a repeat simulation proved effective.",

This study adds to that conversation by elaborating theory at the individual level, examining how variation in entrepreneurial ecosystems impact the new venture ideas entrepreneurs generate. Specifically, we deploy a verbal protocol experiment where the focus and coherence of structural factors and key actors in the ecosystem (i.e., ecosystem convergence) are manipulated and entrepreneurs engage in think-out-loud new venture ideations under the different configurations. An analysis of the qualitative data from 110 new venture ideas generated by 28 entrepreneurs resulted in a novel conceptual model that identifies three distinct types of ecosystem-driven ideation (mimetic, synthetic, and agentic). We then explicate the ecosystem conditions under which each form of ideation is likely to occur. Doing so, we delineate ecosystem convergence around a specific industry as increasing the likelihood of mimetic ideation, with decreasing convergence leading to greater likelihoods of synthetic and then agentic ideation. Our theoretical insights culminate in a set of propositions that improve our understanding of the ways in which entrepreneurial ecosystems shape entrepreneurs thinking and action.",

          "abstract": "Crawling is an almost universal stage of locomotor development in infants; however, it is difficult to quantify using typical motion analysis techniques. The crawling stage therefore has underutilized potential to assess development and detect deviations or abnormalities. This study measured longitudinal weightbearing asymmetries in typically developing (TD) crawling children and compared this population to children with limb loss or limb differences (LLD) using a pressure-sensing mat. The LLD group bore significantly more weight using their arms vs. their legs than the TD group (p &lt; 0.001), but even in cases of unilateral limb loss, bilateral weightbearing symmetry was similar to TD, controlling for body mass and age (p = 0.570). As children in the TD group developed and gained body mass, their weight shifted significantly to their left side (η2 = 0.050) and away from their arms and toward their legs (η2 = 0.255). The results provide insight into the biomechanical development of TD infant crawling, and the ways in which an atypically developing population manages weightbearing during crawling. The establishment of symmetry data will be useful, as crawling can serve as an opportunity for earlier detection of neuromotor conditions such as cerebral palsy. Furthermore, insight into the crawling patterns of children with limb loss and limb difference can inform prosthetic prescription and the need to consider a missing weight shift toward the legs as children develop.",

In this paper, we frame the entrepreneur’s decision to license as a matter of opportunity evaluation and develop a conceptual model of the licensing decision to explore why entrepreneurs may choose to pursue or forego a particular commercialization opportunity via a licensing agreement.",

This study used qualitative and descriptive statistics to examine verbal sexual coercion experiences among a community sample of 114 women and explored the role of sexual precedence in these experiences. Analyses revealed that sexual precedence plays an important role in determining how these experiences come about and why women acquiesce to unwanted intercourse. Verbal persuasion and persistence were the most commonly reported tactics. The valence of this verbal persuasion differed qualitatively according to precedence status, with those having a history of sexual precedence using negative persuasion (e.g., threats to relationship) and those with no precedence relying on positive messages (e.g., sweet talk). Most women used direct verbal resistance to indicate their unwillingness to have sex, regardless of precedence status. Women's reasons for compliance and consequences differed qualitatively according to sexual precedence status.",

Articles in both journals have tended to become longer, to contain more studies, to be authored by more collaborators, and to employ a greater diversity of statistical analyses. Research in both journals has relied heavily on experimental designs using college undergraduates as participants, although the temporal pattern of this reliance is somewhat different in the two journals. Articles in PSPB have consistently emphasized the domain of attitudes and social cognition more than those in JPSP. The implications of these patterns are discussed in terms of their significance for progress in the field and their impact on the career experiences of researchers.",

Because it has been suggested that less parental monitoring at college may be associated with risky behaviors that contribute to sexual aggression, they also compared rates and predictors of sexual aggression for those living with parents versus not living with parents. The results showed that women living away from parents reported significantly higher rates of sexual aggression than women living with parents, regardless of student status. Logistic regression analyses showed that for student and nonstudent women, heavy episodic drinking and number of sex partners predicted past-year rape and/or attempted rape. The current results do not provide evidence that college is a uniquely risky environment for experiencing sexual aggression. Rather, the behaviors in which young women engage are associated with sexual aggression during this time period.",

Evidence from 3 exploratory studies supported the exonerating effects of explanations. Participants generating explicit explanations of harmdoing displayed a more condoning attitude toward perpetrators than did those forming impressions of perpetrators without first explaining the acts. Participants reading social-psychological explanations of harmdoing also judged the researcher to be more condoning of perpetrators than those reading dispositional explanations of the same behavior.

It suggests that social-psychological explanations may be viewed as relatively condoning toward the perpetrators of genocide. It argues that the most central, defining feature of social psychology — one that distinguishes social psychology from other disciplines such as personality, developmental, or clinical psychology — is an emphasis on social influence, or what Ross and Nishett (1991) term the \"power of the situation\". The main point is that social-psychological explanations, in emphasizing the causal power of situational forces, construe actors committing harmful actions as having relatively low personal responsibility and intentionality for their actions, and, in some instances, a low degree of conscious awareness of the determinants of their behaviors. A prototypical experiment in social psychology — for example, on aggression, helping behavior, prejudice, or conformity — randomly assigns participants to different conditions. The logic of random assignment permits the social psychologist to interpret behavior as caused by the situation or by the participant's definition of the situation into which he or she was placed.",

Data collected from two cohorts who completed the first year of the program revealed students’ perceptions of their short-term education abroad experience’s impact on their intercultural competence and leadership development.

Previous research has shown an increase in unhealthy choices amongst young adults, specifically college students (Abraham et al., 2018). The purpose of this research is to determine the extent to which students in different majors know correct information about their health. Questions via survey will be proposed to various majors at Kennesaw State University pertaining to different health topics with the goal of comparing different majors on their health knowledge or misconceptions. After the survey, there will be a post information guide to which the answers will be given. The purpose of the post information guide is to further educate college students about the choices they make and the effect those choices will have on their body and academic success. The questions will focus on how topics such as binge drinking, nutrition, water consumption, and disease prevention. This information could help us find which body of students have the most misconceptions about health and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This information could improve incoming and current students’ outlook on health. Also, this information could improve our university’s required wellness course by helping to inform instructors about health topics that are commonly misconstrued.",

Explanations that focus on situational factors are expected to be viewed as more condoning toward perpetrators than are explanations that focus on dispositions of the harmdoer.

Design/methodology/approach The authors analyze tweets containing the hashtags #Masks4All and #NoMasks over a three-week period, using adjacent hashtag analysis to determine the terms most associated with Karen in the pro and anti-mask communities associated with these hashtags. Findings Anti-maskers reference Karen more often than pro-maskers, although she is presented in negative terms with gendered overtones by those on both sides of the masking debate. Originality/value The paper highlights how hypermasculinity rhetoric impedes social change that normalizes mask wearing.",

It is often difficult for students to fully understand how to apply and use these concepts to analyze foreign policy decision-making processes. One way to encourage such analytical thinking is to have students utilize various models to explain a specific event. While this is a useful task, students often gain a greater level of comprehension when they are evaluating a decision-making process in which they have personally taken part in. As such, role-playing simulation can be a very effective tool in helping students learn to understand and, more importantly, apply these various decision-making models and explanations. This paper presents an example of how simulations can help teach these concepts by presenting specific information regarding a simulation of US–Iranian relations.",

          "abstract": "A cursory look around the world shows that few oil-reliant countries can be categorized as democracies, particularly those in the Middle East. In fact, many studies have suggested that oil wealth hinders democratization. The recent “Arab Spring” and subsequent political instability in oil-producing states such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Syria gives rise to questions regarding the prospects for democracy in these types of countries. This article provides an analysis of the possible role that civil society may play in democratization in oil-reliant states by looking at the case of Algeria. I argue that the seemingly meaningless and artificial acts of “liberalization” initiated by the Algerian government in the late 1980s, which initially allowed civic associations to form, have provided an opening for some civic associations to organize and oppose the government. This process of liberalization, regardless of how empty it may have seemed at first, has “opened floodgates” that now cannot be closed. Thus, the recent protests in Algeria, and continued opposition to the government, can be seen as directly facilitated by the government's prior liberalization and opening of the system to civic associations.

However, despite its increasing use as a teaching tool, only recently have scholars increasingly empirically considered how the use of simulations may impact student learning. Moreover, whereas qualitative studies argue that simulations help student learning, mixed-methods, and quantitative research have been more divided on the impact of simulations. This study, therefore, sets out to investigate how simulations contribute, or not, to student learning in an American Foreign Policy classroom. Specifically, we analyze the use of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Model Diplomacy simulations. We collect data through observation of participants, the use of pretests and post-tests, and surveys, and find support for the idea that simulations in the classroom contribute to student learning.",

Further, the ability to apply knowledge learned during college to real-world settings is a major sought-after skill. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of teaching our students to think critically but also suggest the importance of including activities within our courses that promote the application of ideas. This paper presents research on short in-class activities to promote student learning in knowledge acquisition, application, and critical thinking. In particular, this paper considers the use of these activities in two different courses: Introduction to International Relations and American Foreign Policy. To assess student learning, this paper compares changes in student scores on these activities, as well as considers students’ self-assessment of learning. The findings suggest that the use of these in-class assignments improves students’ ability to define, apply, and analyze course concepts, and also increases student level of engagement.",

          "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, a significant amount of research has been dedicated to refining the causal mechanisms that lead to the diversionary use of force and the various conditions under which such diversionary actions are most likely. This article focuses specifically on the latter—highlighting the research on the various conditions that create opportunities for states to utilize diversionary tactics—while also emphasizing how these opportunities are connected to specific causal processes for diversionary conflict. While significant attention has been paid to the domestic factors that provide additional opportunities for or constraints on actors to utilize diversionary force, less research has considered the international and dyadic opportunities for diversionary force and the interaction and interplay of these domestic and international, or dyadic, factors. These international and dyadic factors specifically focus on those related to the potential target of diversionary conflict and are an important part of fully understanding the decision-making process of leaders contemplating diversionary tactics. Both the domestic and international opportunities for diversionary force identified in the literature will be considered, specifically those focusing on advancements made in understanding the international and dyadic dimensions of these opportunities and the characteristics of potential target states. While the movement toward identifying various opportunities for diversionary behavior, both domestic and international, or dyadic, is an important pathway in diversionary research, this approach comes with some significant challenges. First, diversionary motivations are extremely hard to “prove” since leaders have incentives to hide these motives. This problem is compounded as more opportunities for diversionary force are added to the mix—as these opportunities may, in themselves, provide motives for war. For example, rivalry and territorial disputes are shown as internati",

Considering civil wars from 1970–1999, this study analyzes how the use of terrorism as a tactic affects external interventions on behalf of opposition groups, interventions on behalf of governments, and diplomatic interventions. While some authors would suggest that groups might utilize terrorism as a tactic to gain external support, this study finds little evidence that groups are actually successful in gaining such support. In fact, terrorism that targets civilians appears to actually decrease the likelihood of military interventions on behalf of opposition groups. Furthermore, in civil wars with high numbers of terrorist attacks there is a greater likelihood of economic intervention on behalf of governments, further weakening the potential benefit for groups in utilizing terrorism as a tactic. While this is certainly a welcome finding, a consideration of five case studies of suicide terrorism (Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Iraq, India, and Turkey) provides evidence that the use of suicide terrorism within civil wars may have decreased the likelihood of external interventions on behalf of the government and of diplomatic interventions. These results are more troubling and suggest potentially grave consequences for mediating many of these conflicts.",

This may seem like good news for female faculty, particularly amid continuing reports of gender gaps in publications and citations as well as the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon within promotions. However, a closer look at these findings suggests that in cases in which such awards might be most beneficial to women, they are less likely than their male colleagues to receive such acknowledgments. In fact, women are more likely than men to receive these awards only in institutional contexts in which research output is more important for tenure and promotion than teaching. Thus, the achievement of teaching excellence may have an overall negative impact on the advancement of female faculty by reducing their time and focus available for research.",

Further, the Armed Conflict Location & Data Events Project (ACLED) estimates 91,600 fatalities since 2015 and approximately 11,700 reported civilian fatalities, though the actual number of fatalities is likely higher (ACLED, 2019). As conflict continues to wage, civilians are increasingly being affected, creating an ongoing humanitarian crisis. There are thousands of local, regional, and international humanitarian nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) operating in Yemen, though it is unclear how many of these organisations are extremely active. Despite their enormous number and the potential for aiding the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many have critiqued the process and effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in Yemen (Altman, 2018; Jarhum, 2019). As Altman (2018) from the Center of Strategic and International Studies points out, aid organisations have struggled to meet the needs of the population of Yemen, encountering problems with delivering aid and navigating the political landscape, particularly since the conflict is still ongoing. Whilst the difficulties of providing aid in Yemen have been discussed, little research has considered exactly how the various local NGOs, international NGOs, international organisations, and governments involved in Yemen cooperate or coordinate with each other in their work on the ground. International NGOs and international organisations, such as the United Nations, tend to have significantly more resources than those at the local level; however, local-level organisations have a better, and more nuanced, understanding of the specific concerns faci",

Teaching complex IR theories to students, who are often early in their academic careers, can be a challenge for many academic staff. Our approach uses a carefully structured analogy, based on a dating scenario, to challenge students to explain and theorize the behaviour of the key actors in a way that is transferable to an IR analysis of state behaviour. The exercise yields an intuitive understanding of core theories that facilitates subsequent learning and application.",

Specifically, when offensive military operations are advantaged, international conflict and war become more likely. In contrast, defensive advantages decrease the likelihood of war (see Jervis 1978; Glaser and Kaufmann 1998; Van Evera 1998, 1999). Proponents of offense–defense theory have touted its ability to predict war and international conflict, but they have met much criticism along the way. Scholars have attacked the theoretical basis of the theory, as well as its inability to operationalize the offense–defense balance for empirical testing (see, for example, Levy 1984; Betts 1999). Indeed, even though many scholars have written on the theoretical and methodological aspects of offense–defense theory, few have attempted to test the theory empirically (see Adams 2003–2004; Gortzak, Haftel,...",

This paper adds to the growing literature on diversionary conflict by considering the Ethiopia–Eritrea case and applying an opportunity-based approach. We assess whether the Ethiopia–Eritrea War (1998–2000) is consistent with diversionary explanations for the war, as many have previously claimed.",

The literature also suggests that Indigenous organizations represent groups that traditionally focus on issues of sovereignty, while grappling with unique problems related to assimilation, cultural preservation, and oppression. This study utilizes empirical data gathered from 333 non-governmental organizations affiliated with the United Nations Human Rights Council to explore whether Indigenous and non-Indigenous organizations, which share many aspects of their mission with one another at the transnational level, differ on issues related to environment sustainability and collective identity rights. Our results indicate that Indigenous organizations take a more holistic approach in addressing the relationship between humans and the natural world, centring marginalized perspectives through restorative justice and the needs of current and future generations.",

We find strong support that trust in institutions affects majority and minority political participation differently. These results highlight the divergent processes at work in the relationships between political trust and political participation across majority and minority citizens in Turkey due to their varied experiences with these institutions. Some of our most interesting findings show that minorities, unlike citizens from the majority group who have higher trust in police, are more likely to protest, and minorities with trust in political parties are actually less likely to join these parties.

While international terrorist acts are quite visible and highly publicized, such attacks represent only one type of terrorism within the international system. In fact, a very large number of acts of terrorism take place within the context of civil wars. Given the great disparity in power in most civil wars, it is not surprising that terrorism might be seen as a tactic that is often used by insurgent groups, who may have few resources at their disposal to fight a much stronger opponent. There is a clear linkage between the concepts of terrorism and civil war, yet until recently scholars have largely approached civil war and terrorism separately. Recent literature has attempted to specifically map the intersection of terrorism and civil war, recognizing the extent to which the two overlap. As expected, the findings suggest that civil war and terrorism are highly linked. Other scholars have endeavoured to explain why rebel groups in some civil wars use terrorism, while others do not. Further research focuses on how governments respond to terrorism during civil war or on how the decisions of external actors to intervene in civil wars are affected by the use of terrorism by insurgent groups. These studies show that there is too little theorizing on the relationship between civil war and terrorism; while scholars are finally considering these concepts collectively, the full nature of their relationship remains unexplored. Additional research is needed to better understand the various ways that terrorism and civil war overlap, interact, and mutually affect other important international and domestic political processes.",

Brown cautions political scientists tempted by the siren song of likes and page views to void conflating popularity of content with the value of content.Instead, Brown challenges us to consider the long-term impact of each contribution, and to value works offering enduring insights over positional pieces that are quickly shared but quickly forgotten.",

We use data from three surveys of over 2700 respondents consisting of students in introductory American Politics courses. We asked students their preferences for course format and their experiences in online, hybrid, and traditional classrooms with respect to expressing their individual voices, hearing from people from different backgrounds, and providing a sense of community. We are interested in assessing how students from diverse backgrounds (gender, race, disability status) experience these varied formats of learning.

The project will achieve four major objectives: 1) provide scholarships 2) engage students with engineering faculty and industry partners; 3) create community among students; and 4) facilitate undergraduate research. Research questions aligned with the project objectives will address the following areas: RQ1: influence of mentorship on feelings of intellectual belonging? RQ2: influence of community building on experience RQ3: influence of participation in socially conscious research on intent to persist. We describe how expectancy-value-cost motivational theory is used to implement programming addressing these questions and analyze field notes and survey data to investigate how project programming may impact expectancy for success, value accrued, and costs for participation on the part of students.",

The teacher and two students participated in interviews with the researcher. Classroom observations were made of all students for each class period over the course of two weeks, 15.5 hours per week. The first week was scheduled at the start of a unit on Africa and allowed the researcher to observe students before they interacted with technology. The second week of observation occurred as students worked in teams to create their own studycasts. The teacher explained performance criteria and provided ongoing scaffolding throughout the study period. Three themes emerged from the data analysis. The first theme was practicality. The teacher perceived that his students were not spending enough time reviewing for tests largely because they could not, or would not, attend after school study sessions. The second theme, storytelling describes this teacher’s unique way of using studycasts in his classroom. Students created stories that incorporated class content, recording these as studycasts and making these available to their classmates and others via an RSS feed on a classroom website. The final theme, motivation, describes the teacher’s and students’ perceptions of the benefits of studycasts in classroom learning.",

When the stylus and tablet evolved to pens and papyrus, teachers were at the forefront of that shift. As the technologies of the 21st century usher in unprecedented advancements in student achievement and educational practice, teachers once again find themselves at the vanguard of a revolution. The purpose of this comparative qualitative case study was to gain insight into how teachers make sense out of technology in the classroom. There are many emerging technologies that stand poised to have significant and enduring impacts on not only what students learn but on the ways that they acquire information. This study focused on one such advancement, podcasting. This study was conducted to help fill a void in current research primarily by centering the voice of the classroom teachers in the discussion of how they make sense out of podcasting technologies. Within this qualitative case study, data were received through two middle school social studies teachers located in the Midwest. Each teacher provided one interview and triangulation occurred through five student interviews, 52 hours worth of observations and online/offline documentation. Based on the inductive analysis of the data, numerous themes emerged from the heuristic primary research questions. These findings included the use of podcasting in an adjunct role within both teachers' classroom curriculum, studycasts were used to help students review for tests, podcasts were used to help students remember academic content and the teachers conducted ongoing self-assessments to continuously improve their podcasting activities. Overall, both teachers were satisfied with the podcasting technology, with how it complements their classroom curriculum, and most importantly with how in this era of unprecedented educational regulation podcasting impacts student growth and achievement.",

The focus of this review is based on Lamb's six phases of designing an effective school web page. The six phases in creating an educational web site include exploration, planning, designing, creating, revising, and maintaining. The primary functions of a school web site must not be overlooked. It is important to incorporate the students' accomplishments, calendars, school mission, and vision. By using the four fundamentals of web design (contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity), web sites can be enhanced by creating a more professional look for the viewer.\\nThe presented information will support the fundamentals of constructing a school web site and examples will be provided. The site must be maintained so that students, parents, and faculty members are kept informed. If done correctly, the school web site can have its highest potential when designed for the students, parents, and faculty of the school.",

The usefulness of the Reflective Judgment Model as a tool for assessing the value of SSI is established in the parallels that can be drawn between them. Both involve ill‐structured problems requiring evidence‐based reasoning subject to differing interpretations by students, and both require examination, analysis and the blending of scientific and normative evidence, as students use that evidence to support a reasoned position. Results demonstrated both qualitative evidence revealing more sophisticated and nuanced epistemological stances toward higher stages of reflective judgment, as well as statistically significant gains within treatment groups with a moderately large effect size. Theoretical implications for advancing students' epistemological beliefs about evidence‐based argumentation and pedagogical implications for rethinking how to connect science with topics that are fundamentally meaningful to students are discussed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

          "abstract": "There is a distinct divide between theory and practice in American science education. Research indicates that a constructivist philosophy, in which students construct their own knowledge, is conductive to learning, while in many cases teachers continue to present science in a more traditional manner. This study sought to explore possible relationships between a socioscientific issues based curriculum and three outcome variables: nature of science understanding, reflective judgment, and argumentation skill. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to examine both whole class differences as well as individual differences between the beginning and end of a semester of high school Biology I. Results indicated that the socioscientific issues based curriculum did not produce statistically significant changes over the course of one semester. However, the treatment group scored better on all three instruments than the comparison group. The small sample size may have contributed to the inability to find statistical significance in this study. The qualitative interviews did indicate that some students provided more sophisticated views on nature of science and reflective judgment, and were able to provide slightly more complex argumentation structures. Theoretical implications regarding the use of explicit use of socioscientific issues in the classroom are presented.",

While growing in size by more than 50% during this period, this population became increasingly inexperienced and less male dominated. Biology teachers also were drawn primarily from in-field degree graduates and remained racially homogeneous. We synthesize our data with previous studies to conclude that biology teachers are most likely among all science teachers to teach outside of their discipline as part of their workload. We discuss consequences of a large, highly qualified teacher population stepping outside of their content area for part of their course load, as it relates to self-efficacy and professional identity. Implications for large-scale STEM education reform and a scientifically literate US population are examined within the context of these findings.",

However, teachers face challenges in knowing how and why to incorporate the CCCs in their planning and teaching, and more information is needed about the use of CCCs in three-dimensional learning and teaching. In this qualitative study, we consider how 31 elementary teachers use the CCCs in their planning for three-dimensional learning and how the teachers describe their successes, challenges, and use of the CCCs in their classrooms. The teachers engaged in a week-long professional development focused on writing three-dimensional lesson plans with an explicit focus on the use of the CCCs in elementary classrooms. Our analyses showed that all the lesson plans included use of the CCCs to support students’ 3D sensemaking. However, certain CCCs were used more than others and explicit use of the CCCs by students was uncommon. In addition, a mismatch existed between what CCCs the teachers claimed to use in their lesson plans and what was used in their lessons. In describing their successes and challenges with use of the CCCs in the classroom, the teachers typically discussed students’ experiences and knowledge with the CCCs. Implications for teacher educators and curriculum developers are discussed.",

Design/methodology/approach This design case traces a systems approach to designing a centralized and sustainable university micro-credential initiative. Sources include historical documents from the original working group, email-documented community feedback, current initiative communications, participant report, and frequency counts of micro-credentials awarded. This data is used to recount the design process and key decisions that led to revisions, or iterations, of the initiative's design. Findings The institution has seen rapid growth in the awarding of micro-credentials. Lessons learned included the need for thoughtful inclusion of stakeholders, selective terminology, a well-communicated attitude of iteration, repurposing of established tools and processes, and on-going support of academic faculty. Research limitations/implications Like any design case, this study is not generalizable. Originality/value This paper provides a unique empirical account of the design, development, and implementation of a micro-credential initiative that functioned in tandem with, rather than in conflict with, shared governance and academic traditions at a higher education institution.",

This charge resulted in major shifts in teacher education programs in the USA as colleges and universities forged new partnerships to create yearlong clinical experiences that included co-teaching (Bacharach, Heck, & Dahlberg, 2010) and coaching (Strieker, Lim, Hubbard, Crovitz, Gray, Holbein, & Steffen, 2017). Early in 2018, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) Commission on Clinical Experiences recognized and described the mutual benefits of expanding these partnerships between schools and universities to include various forms of collaboration, co-teaching and coaching. While these partnerships are increasing in number, little is known about the efficacy of the specific practices employed in the co-taught classroom. This self-study examined the communication approaches and pedagogical practices of 13co-teaching coaches who consulted with 39 teacher candidates enrolled in yearlong, co-taught P-12 clinical experiences. The co-teaching coaches attended up to four sessions of professional learning on co-teaching and coaching (Center for Educational Placements and Partnerships, 2015). Basic statistics were used to determine the demographics of the group of co-teaching coaches, the content of their dialogue, as well as their preferred coaching approaches. The main data sources were the coaches’ resumes, their reflections on goal-setting sessions, observation reports, and surveys on their daily coaching activities. Results indicated that effective coaches engaged in collaborative dialogue that moved candidates to self-directed learning. Similarly, these results described the pedagogical practices of effective coaches in terms of goal-setting with the candidates, basic mentoring, and demonstration teaching.",

The 3DPE is a coordinated system of hardware, software, and people that has been intentionally designed to scale computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D printing (3DP) at an institutional level. CAD and 3DP are two prime examples of technologies that support STEAM by blending engineering with the arts. These technologies, however, are typically only taught in select university courses that focus on engineering, product development, and industrial design. In recent years, the availability of affordable, reliable, and highly maintainable 3D printers has created an opportunity to infuse CAD and 3DP as a shared set of literacies that can cross disciplinary boundaries. The 3DPE consists of a decentralized series of 3DP labs, a centralized 3DP server, and faculty training. Using a train-the-trainer model, the 3DPE supports STEAM education by training faculty in CAD and 3DP while also providing ongoing curricular support to infuse these skills into their courses through project-based learning. This article provides preliminary examples of how the 3DPE is supporting STEAM education and offers advice for others seeking to replicate the model.",

          "abstract": "The height of the intersection between the free surface and a ship hull is of interest for many naval architecture applications. For example, wave height at a station influences the probability of water on deck, and wetted elevation at a buttock on a transom influences resistance forces. Determining this parameter through testing (either model- or full-scale) can be accomplished through various methods, many of which involve placing one or more measurement instruments in the flow field (e.g. resistance or capacitance probes or wires). However, the presence of these elements in the system can affect the flow itself. Non-invasive techniques, including sonic methods and laser-enabled technologies, avoid this issue, though there are benefits and drawbacks associated with these techniques as well. Measurement system complexity, in particular, can drive experimental cost and schedule. Some proven methods may provide more spatial resolution than is necessary to meet experimental objectives, providing extraneous information at additional cost. Image processing of digital camera video frames can be an effective non-invasive technique, though many commercially-available image processing tools are not designed specifically for this application. Though quite robust, these tools can add unnecessary time and cost to data processing for the waterline elevation problem. This paper lays out computationally-efficient image processing software methods which can be implemented in Matlab (without requiring additional toolboxes) to determine free surface elevation along a ship hull at a station or buttock using video files generated by cameras trained on the hull in the area of interest.",

          "abstract": "Context : Blood flow restriction resistance exercise studies often require caffeine abstinence to avoid cardiovascular effects that could change the blood flow restriction stimulus. However, effects may be attenuated for habituated users. Objective : To compare cardiovascular responses to blood flow restriction resistance exercise when habituated users consume or abstain from caffeine. Design : Thirty participants completed a 3-visit within-subject study beginning with familiarization and caffeine intake questionnaire. Methods : Visits 2 and 3 consisted of blood flow restriction resistance exercise (3 sets bicep curls to failure, 30% 1-repetition max, 40% arterial occlusion pressure [AOP]), following participants’ normal caffeine consumption (CAFF) or abstaining (ABS). AOP, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate were measured preexercise and postexercise. Prevalues and preexercise to postexercise change scores for SBP, DBP, AOP (all millimeters of mercury), heart rate (in beats per minute), and repetitions were compared between conditions. Results are represented as mean (SD). Results : Preexercise AOP was similar for CAFF (137.8 [14.4]) and ABS (137.1 [14.9], BF 10 = 0.2), although pre-SBP was higher for CAFF (115.4 [9.8]) than ABS (112.3 [9.4], BF 10 = 1.9). Pre-DBP was similar between conditions. The exercise-induced change in AOP was greater for CAFF (18.4 [11.2]) than ABS (13.2 [14.9]), though evidence was anecdotal (BF 10 = 0.7). Exercise-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and heart rate were similar between conditions (all BF 10 ≤ 0.40). More repetitions were completed for CAFF (63 [26]) than ABS (57 [17], BF 10 = 2.1). Conclusions : The findings of this study suggest that for habituated users, maintaining daily caffeine habits will not have substantial effects on common cardiovascular variables relevant to blood flow restriction.",

(1999) type methodology to quarterly data for the 1985–2002 time period, we show that, since the mid-1990s, but not before then, managers seek to avoid negative quarterly earnings surprises more than to avoid either quarterly losses or quarterly earnings decreases. Our findings suggest that the quarterly earnings threshold hierarchy proposed by Degeorge et al. (1999) does not apply to recent years, and that managers' claim that avoiding quarterly earnings decreases is the threshold they most seek to achieve (Graham et al. 2004) is inconsistent with their actions. We provide an intuitively appealing economic rationale for why the shift in threshold hierarchy occurred; since the mid-1990s, but not before then, investors unambiguously rewarded (penalized) firms for reporting quarterly earnings meeting (missing) analysts' estimates more than they did for meeting (missing) the other two thresholds. We provide several explanations for why investors unambiguously reward firms for reporting quarterly earnings that meet or beat analysts' estimates more than for meeting the other two thresholds late (but not early) in our sample period: increased media coverage given to analyst forecasts, more analyst following, more firms covered by analysts, and temporal increases in both the accuracy and precision of analyst forecasts.",

We also examine the effect of uniformity on analyst coverage, analyst forecast accuracy and analyst forecast dispersion. We develop a Compustat‐based financial statement account uniformity measure based on the presentation of common financial statement line items. We define uniformity using a Jaccard similarity index where a firm's non‐missing Compustat data items are compared to a prototypical firm for that industry year. We emphasize the conceptual difference between uniformity and comparability, and our tests do not show a significant association between uniformity and output‐based accounting comparability. However, we find that the association between account uniformity and comparability becomes positive in high research and development firms, while it becomes negative in firms with higher managerial discretion. We explore the association between uniformity and information processing efficiencies, and we show that our uniformity measure is positively associated with analyst coverage. Furthermore, we partition our uniformity measure into separate income statement and balance sheet components. We find that income statement uniformity is associated with higher forecast accuracy and lower forecast dispersion, while balance sheet uniformity is associated with greater analyst coverage. Finally, we provide further support for these findings using an XBRL‐based uniformity measure.",

Our results indicate that analysts underreact more to earnings information revealed by consistent‐signal earnings expectation paths than to earnings information communicated by inconsistent‐signal expectation paths. We also find that the current earnings expectation path provides incremental explanatory power for future abnormal returns, even after controlling for the sign and magnitude of the earnings surprise. Overall, our evidence is consistent with underreaction stemming from analysts’ and investors’ bias in processing the information in consistent‐signal earnings expectation paths.",

We report and interpret academic research demonstrating that this activity is somewhat common, and provide practical suggestions that auditors can use to identify it.

Specifically, we contend that firms use accelerated depreciation to credibly signal higher future earnings and cash flows, consistent with signaling theory. Compared to straight-line depreciation, accelerated depreciation reduces earnings in the earlier years of asset lives and produces more variability in earnings. Despite these drawbacks, hundreds of firms voluntarily use accelerated depreciation for at least some of their depreciable assets. Our results indicate that the use of accelerated depreciation foreshadows higher future earnings and cash flows for horizons of one, two, and three years ahead.",

Evidence in prior research suggests that managers try to avoid reporting a negative earnings surprise and that market participants place greater weight on the information contained in earnings announcements than on earnings forecast revisions during a quarter (Soffer et al. 2000; Bartov et al. 2002). This notion is consistent with recency theory in the context of individual judgment and decision-making behavior (Hogarth and Einhorn, 1992). We extend prior research by investigating the descriptive validity of recency theory to a comprehensive set of potential earnings paths. Our evidence suggests, contrary to conclusions in the prior literature, that investors do not always assign more weight to earnings surprises than to analyst forecast revisions. Rather, our results suggest that the market response to earnings news is more consistent with prospect theory, an alternative cognitive psychology theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979).",

I provide descriptive evidence of deferred revenue both at an industry-level and a macro-level, and I examine whether managers use discretion in deferred revenue around earnings benchmarks. I develop a model to measure the normal change in short-term deferred revenue, and examine how the abnormal change varies across the pre-managed distribution of three common earnings benchmarks. My results show that managers delay recognition of revenue using deferred revenue when pre-managed earnings exceed benchmarks by a large margin, and accelerate the recognition of revenue using deferred revenue when premanaged earnings just miss or miss benchmarks by a large amount. I document the prevalence of accelerated revenue recognition, and show that meeting or just beating the annual consensus analyst forecast is where the most cases of suspected accelerated revenue recognition occur. The results are next strongest for the avoidance of earnings decrease benchmark and weakest for the avoidance of loss benchmark. I examine whether conventional abnormal accrual models reflect discretion in deferred revenue, and whether discretion in deferred revenue is associated with lower earnings quality. I show that deferred revenue changes are a leading indicator of future earnings. My results indicate that discretion in revenue can lower the predictability of sales regardless of whether it is of an aggressive or conservative nature.",

We examine whether forecast properties (accuracy, bias, and dispersion) of book value forecasts and the market reaction to unexpected book value surprises differ between financial and nonfinancial firms. We find that book value forecasts are more accurate, less biased, and less dispersed for financial firms compared to nonfinancial firms. In addition, we show that these results are not simply a result of differences in earnings per share (EPS) forecast quality. We also provide evidence that book value forecasts are incrementally helpful to analysts in forecasting earnings for financial firms. In addition, we find evidence that the stock price drift following an earnings announcement is more pronounced when book value per share (BPS) surprises are considered in addition to EPS surprises. However, this finding only holds for financial firms. We find that this delayed reaction can form the basis for a profitable trading strategy.",

Here, the thiol–Michael reaction is demonstrated to be thermally responsive and dynamic. Small molecule model experiments demonstrate the potential for the thiol–Michael adducts to be used in dynamic covalent chemistry. Thiol–acrylate adducts are incorporated into a cross-linker to form a soft polymeric material. These thiol–Michael cross-linked materials display healing after being cut and malleability characteristics at 90 °C. Additionally, the data suggest that there is limited creep and stress relaxation at room temperature with complete recovery of creep once the strain is removed. These thiol–Michael cross-linked polymers show dynamic properties upon thermal stimulus, with long-term stability against mechanical deformation in the absence of this stimulus, opening the way for them to be used in various applications.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic covalent materials have properties such as self-healing, recyclability, and stress relaxation because of the dynamic exchange in polymer networks. Here, kinetic exchange in anilinium salts and viscoelastic properties of dynamic covalent networks with anilinium linkages are extensively studied. Mechanistic studies show that dynamic exchange in anilinium salts follows a dissociative pathway. Small-molecule kinetics study suggests that despite the dissociative mechanism, there is an essentially constant molar composition or bond density across a wide temperature profile. Rheological studies indicate that covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with anilinium linkages provide viscoelastic properties similar to CANs with associative exchange process networks. Additionally, thermal- and microwave-responsive self-healing and malleability properties can be achieved in this network, along with the materials showing excellent creep resistance and creep recovery.",

The mechanism of dynamic exchange between quaternary anilinium salt and free aniline was assessed in small-molecule model experiments. The dynamic exchange was found to be dissociative in nature, due to the indirect S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism, where initially the bromide anion attacks the anilinium salt to generate an alkyl bromide which undergoes subsequent attack by a free aniline group. A quaternary anilinium-based cross-linker was synthesized to act as dynamic linkages in the polymer network. Cross-linked polymeric materials showed thermoresponsive rehealing and malleability properties at 60 °C along with being resistant to irreversible creep under ambient conditions. The use of anilinium salts enables dynamic exchange to occur with significantly milder thermal stimulus than other comparable materials, while maintaining mechanical stability.",

Here, a computational study on the mechanical behavior of dynamically cross‐linked polymer networks is presented. Coarse grained models for different polymer network configurations are established and their mechanical properties using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are predicted. Consistent with the experimental measurements, the simulation results show that interpenetrating networks (IPN) withstand considerably higher stress compared to the single networks (SN). Additionally, the MD results demonstrate that the origin of this variation in mechanical behavior of IPN and SN configurations goes back to the difference in spatial degrees of freedom of the noncovalent cross‐linkers, represented by nonbonded interactions within the two system types. The results of this work provide new insight for future studies on the design of systems with dual dynamic cross‐linkers where one linkage exchanges rapidly and provides autonomic dynamic character, while the other is a stimulus responsive dynamic covalent linkage that provides stability with dynamic exchange on‐demand.",

We use dynamic mechanical analysis to demonstrate that the activation barrier to the glass transition process is significantly elevated for bullvalene-containing materials relative to \"static\" control networks. Furthermore, bullvalene rearrangements can be mechanically perturbed at low temperatures in the glassy region; such behavior facilitates energy dissipation (i.e., increased hysteresis energy) and polymer chain alignment to stiffen the material (i.e., increased Young's modulus) under load.

Then, we use dynamic mechanical analysis to demonstrate that the activation barrier to glass transition is significantly elevated for bullvalene-containing materials (ca. 90 kcal/mol) relative to “static” control networks (ca. 50 kcal/mol). Furthermore, bullvalene rearrangements can be “mechanically activated” at low temperature in the glassy region; such behavior facilitates energy dissipation (at least ca. 3-fold increase in hysteresis energy) and polymer chain alignment to stiffen the material (at least ca. 2-fold increase in Young’s modulus) under load. Collectively, this work showcases bullvalene as a reversible chemical mechanophore in the modulation of viscoelastic behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Abstract Carbonate mineralization, the conversion of CO 2 into stable, thermodynamically favorable carbonate minerals, offers a promising strategy for permanent and environmentally friendly carbon storage, with minimal risk of long‐term leakage and minimal monitoring requirements. Drawing inspiration from carbonic anhydrase (CA), a family of zinc‐containing metalloenzymes that catalyze the hydration of CO 2 to bicarbonate and promote carbonate precipitation, a class of histidine‐containing peptoids was designed that is capable of coordinating with Zn 2+ ions to act as CA mimetics for accelerating calcite step growth. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal that these peptoids significantly enhance step advancement, with a more pronounced effect observed when combined with Zn 2+ ions and under higher calcium‐to‐carbonate activity ratios, indicating that peptoids facilitate the incorporation of CO 3 2− ions at step edges. Solution NMR and 3D atomic force microscopy (3D AFM) analyses show that the coordination of peptoids with Zn 2+ promotes both the deprotonation of HCO 3 − to CO 3 2− and restructures the interfacial hydration layers of calcite, collectively lowering the activation barrier for step growth. These findings establish a design framework for sequence‐defined polymers to regulate carbonate mineralization, offering promising applications in CO 2 capture and long‐term storage.",

          "abstract": "Agroforestry systems (AFS) and practices followed in India are highly diverse due to varied climatic conditions ranging from temperate to humid tropics. The estimated area under AFS in India is 13.75 million ha with the highest concentration being in the states of Uttar Pradesh (1.86 million ha), followed by Maharashtra (1.61 million ha), Rajasthan (1.55 million ha) and Andhra Pradesh (1.17 million ha). There are many forms of agroforestry practice in India ranging from intensified simple systems of monoculture, such as block plantations and boundary planting, to far more diverse and complex systems, such as home gardens. As a result, the biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of AFS are highly variable across different agro-climatic zones of India. Studies pertaining to the assessment of biomass and carbon storage in different agroforestry systems in the Indian sub-continent are scanty and most of these studies have reported region and system specific carbon stocks. However, while biomass and carbon stock data from different AFS at national scale has been scanty hitherto, such information is essential for national accounting, reporting of C sinks and sources, as well as for realizing the benefits of carbon credit to farmers engaged in tree-based production activities. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate and synthesize the existing information on biomass carbon and SOC stocks associated with agroforestry practices across agro-climatic zones of India. The results revealed considerable variation in biomass and carbon stocks among AFS, as well as between different agro-climatic zones. Higher total biomass (&gt;200 Mg ha−1) was observed in the humid tropics of India which are prevalent in southern and northeastern regions, while lower total biomass (&lt;50 Mg ha−1) was reported from Indo-Gangetic, western and central India. Total biomass carbon varied in the range of 1.84 to 131 Mg ha−1 in the agrihorticulture systems of western and cent",

The study was conducted at Jaldapara National Park located in the Eastern Himalayan region of India. The study quantified litter production, decomposition, periodic nutrient release, soil fertility status, and soil organic carbon (SOC) of five major forest stands i.e., Tectona grandis (TGDS), Shorea robusta (SRDS), Michelia champaca (MCDS), Lagerstroemia parviflora (LPDS) and miscellaneous stand (MS). A stratified random nested quadrate method was adopted for sample collection. Results reveal that the greatest amount of litter production and decomposition was under MCDS followed by MS, LPDS, SRDS, and the smallest under TGDS. The material annual turnover through litter decomposition in all the stands varies between 96.46% and 99.34%. The content and amount of the available nutrients in litter varied significantly among the stands. Moreover, release of these nutrients was nearly equal to the amount available in the initial litter mass. In general, the magnitude of the total nutrient return was in the same order as the total litter fall and the nutrient availability was more closely related to litter nutrient content and soil organic carbon. The range of pH (4.86–5.16), EC (0.34–0.50), soil moisture (27.01–31.03) and available primary nutrients (N: (0.21–0.26 Mg/ha), P: (0.09–0.12 Mg/ha), K: (0.13–0.14 Mg/ha)) also varied significantly among the stands. Significant positive correlations were observed between SOC, N and K. Both the fertility indices exhibited no definite pattern in the stands but a significant correlation between the two indicates the healthy soil fertility status of the stands. SOC varies significantly under different forest stands, but the greatest content was found under MS. The estimated SOC ranges between 75.9 and 107.7 Mg ha−1 up to 60 cm and is reported to be below the Indian average of 182.94 Mg ha−1.",

The study also documented the gap between prices of NTFP items at the household level and in local markets. Multistage sampling procedures were applied with a sample size of 205. The data collected were analyzed through descriptive statistics and Chi-Square (χ2) test. Insignificant values of Chi-Square (χ2) test reveal that there is no association or relationship of NTFP dependency with the socioeconomic and demographic variables of the respondents. The communities do rely on NTFPs for their daily, sociocultural, and cash requirements and assure a safety net during scarcity. There is a variable contribution of NTFPs to total monthly household income (1–70%). We documented 43 species of NTFPs sold either as raw or as processed form. The NTFPs sold were in the form of twigs, shoot, fruit, seed, leaves, mushroom, and fish. A wide gap exists between the price realized by the community from the sale of NTFPs and those sold in the local markets. This calls for institutional intervention for capacity building and empowering the community for processing or value addition and market intelligence.",

          "abstract": "In the modern era, Gmelina arborea plantations are a hotspot of future research because of their high carbon sequestration potential. The present work was conducted during 2018 to 2020 on a young unmanaged Gmelina farm to understand the ecosystem’s carbon and its dynamics. The study area was categorized into three age classes: ≤5, 5–10, and 10–15 years. In a plantation, Gmelina trees (10%) were randomly selected while other trees (90%) were also taken into the consideration for ecosystem carbon. A stratified random nested quadrate sampling method was adopted for analyzing other vegetation forms under study. Overall, 51 individual species in the studied Gmelina farm were found which includes 23 tree species, 7 shrub species, 16 herbs, 2 climbers, and 3 species of ferns. The estimated quantitative vegetation parameters and diversity indices indicate that the plant assemblages were heterogeneous with native diverse species evenly distributed with fairly higher densities, frequencies, and abundance. Herbs were the most important species followed by shrubs and trees. Consequently, with the increasing age of plantation, the richness of plant species increased. Soil properties were significantly influenced by the age of the plantation but exhibited no discreet trend. Total biomass density and total carbon density increased with increasing plantation age while no drastic variation was found in available soil organic carbon (SOC) because of insignificant variability in litter production. Total carbon, available SOC (up to 60 cm depth) and ecosystem carbon in the three age class plantations fell in the ranges of 54.51–59.91, 48.18–55.73, and 104.81–110.77 Mg ha−1, respectively. The carbon sequestration potential of Gmelina arborea is higher compared to other reported species and highly supportive of converting unutilized agricultural landscapes to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide in future.",

However, considerable numbers of people are still living in utter penury and are deprived of a dignified living. In such tough circumstances nature’s free gift in the form of wild edible foods are benefiting the vulnerable and dependent communities. Wild edible plants (WEPs) are the species those are neither cultivated nor domesticated however are available in their wild natural habitat and used as sources of these plants have played a significant role in the development and civilization of human history throughout the ages and globe. These wild edible plants have played a significant role in supplying food and nutritional requirements of poor communities in many rural parts of the world. These wild edibles can be popularized only when they are comparedfor their nutritional and health benefits with major or widely used cultivated plants. The social, cultural, religious, and belief system of the rural communities are incomplete without these wild edible plants. Domestication of these wild edible plants can increase their use and their conservation as well. The present review paper has described the wild edible plants in context of their diversity, traditional knowledge, conservation practices and nutritional composition from the available secondary literature. Authors feel there is still scope to incorporate more contextual variables for explaining more variations embedded with local people’s perception on values and usage of these wild edible fruits.",

The state is populated by several ethnic communities, which still rely on various ethnomedical practises. Unfortunately information relating to the medicinally useful species is not holistic or is fraganmentory. We thus felt for a meta-analysis and abridged the available information of the stateMethods: The purpose of the present study was to annotate the published information on ethnomedicinal plants used by various indigenous communities of West Bengal, India. We therefore searched the published Journal articles, book chapters, and scientific reports using Web of Science, Scopus, Google, Google Scholar, individual journal databases and personal communication to review the ethnomedicinal information of the state.Resutls: The meta-analysis resulted to a repository of 377 plant species represented by 99 families and 278 genera which were utilized for folk medicinal purposes. These ethnomedicinal plant species were used to treat a total of 126 different ailments and diseases. Stomach related problems were found common among the ethnic groups for which about half of the listed plant species were used for its treatment. Santal ethnic group was found richest with traditional knowledge related to folk medicinal purposes of 195 plant species. Some plant species Aerva lanata and Aristolochia indica were found commonly utilized by the communities. Leaves were prominently used plant part for folk therapies. Harvesting of the plants or their parts was largely unsustainable and is a matter of concern which needs urgent conservation action. Moreover, neglect and disregard to traditional culture and lores by the younger generation of the traditional communities is causing rapid decline and making the traditional knowledge system of these communities obsolete.Conclusion: Documentation of ethnomedicinal plant species and the associated traditional knowledge is vita",

Litter is the principal source of organic matter for soils in the forest ecosystem. The litter, upon decomposition, makes available essential nutrients for the growth and development of a forest stand. Different tree components contain different amounts of nutrients; and build up of soil organic matter. The amount of nutrients added through litter decomposition varies with forest types, species, stand attributes, and variation in seasonal environmental conditions. Nutrient return from organic matter is estimated by the physico-chemical properties of the litter. Moreover, the rate of decomposition and the nutrient releases are highly influenced by magnitude of litter produced, litter quality and nutrients release, as well as, by climatic conditions and existing microbial communities in the soil system. Ecological impact of carbon and nutrient dynamics in the litter layer is considerable in a forest ecosystem.",

For the mass production of the seedlings, easy and convenient techniques are lacking while, micro propagation was reported promising but still out of reach at farm level. The unavailability of quality planting materials due to non-viable seeds is restricting its mass commercial scale cultivation. The present study was therefore attempted to standardize the plant growth regulators and growing media to standardize the vegetative propagation protocol through cuttings for its mass multiplication in Terai region of West Bengal, India. Methods Growing media (soil, FYM, saw dust and sand) as sole and in combination and growth hormones (IAA, IBA and NAA in different concentration and a commercial formulation i.e. Totoroot© with different exposure time) were compared with control (i.e. sole soil and no hormone treatment, respectively) to standardize the nursery protocol of Stevia. Results Sand used as sole was found the best growing media for survival and growth of cuttings while, cuttings treated with commercial growth hormone formulation for 5 mins was best. Cuttings treated with commercial growth hormone formulation performed significantly better in the field with respect to survival, growth and production of leaves. Conclusion The study recommends the use of sole sand media and commercial growth hormone formulation with 5 mins exposure time for mass nursery production of Stevia cuttings in Terai zone of West Bengal due to their better performance both in the nursery and after transplanting in the field.",

Indian cities are now experiencing high level of pollutions, so trees not only act as carbon sinks but also assist in improving the quality of urban life. Cooch Behar town located in northern part of West Bengal is also experiencing upsurge in urban development and population increase. Therefore the community parks and an institutional campus in the town were assessed for their species richness and the ecosystem services they provide. A total of 75 species represented by 39 families and 67 genera were documented from the urban green sites of Cooch Behar town. The dominant family found was Fabaceae followed by Arecaceae and Moraceae while Ficus was listed as dominant genus. The plant species documented were prominently classified under provisioning type of ecosystem services as 36 species were timbers, 26 species were edible and 24 species were fodder. Other services included species for providing shade (34 species), avenue (27 species) and aesthetic (25 species). The list also included plant species under IUCN Red list category of vulnerable species like Saraca asoca; endangered species like Swietenia mahagoni and Borassus flabellifer and Platycladus orientalis as threatened species. The maintenance of these IUCN Red listed species by the community parks and institutional campus of Cooch Behar town supports the belief that the urban green sites are also a crucial refuge for regional plant diversity in crowded, concrete and human dominated landscape.",

The dominant plant families were Combretaceae, Rutaceae and Lamiaceae with 3 species each. Among various stomach related disorders, gastroenteritis was cured by maximum number of plant species (15), followed by dysentery (14) and stomach pain (9). Most dominant plant parts used were leaf of (20) species followed by fruit (13) and bark (8). The plant parts are employed by the inhabitants in the form of infusion, decoction, paste, latex etc. either as a sole drug or in the combination of other species. The documented plant species can be utilized by scientific community for further evaluation and recommendations to the practicing communities.",

          "abstract": "Prior to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, audit partners experienced economic pressure to grow revenue from the sale of nonaudit services to their audit clients. To an auditor who is highly rewarded for revenue generation and growth, nonaudit services may represent a particularly strengthened economic bond with the client. Prior research shows that, in general, nonaudit service fees received in the current period do not impair audit quality. We examine a different setting. We propose that auditor independence can become impaired, and audit quality compromised, when clients that currently purchase relatively low amounts of nonaudit services, increase their purchases of nonaudit services from the auditor in the subsequent period. We test our prediction in the context of earnings management as a proxy for audit quality, measured by (a) performance‐adjusted discretionary accruals and (b) classification shifting of core expenses. Our results indicate that prior to the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act, rewards to the auditor in the form of future additional nonaudit service fees from current‐year high fee‐growth‐opportunity clients adversely affects audit quality. This effect is particularly strong among companies with powerful incentives to manage earnings. Our findings indicate that regulators should consider the multiperiod nature of the client–auditor relationship when contemplating policies that restrict nonaudit services, as well as the overall environment in which audit partners operate. This might include partner compensation arrangements that put pressure on audit partners to focus on increasing revenue at the expense of audit quality.",

To provide evidence on this issue, we examine the impact of alternative accounting schemes for R&amp;D costs on the extent to which earnings and book values jointly explain the observed distribution of share prices. One alternative requires firms to capitalize and amortize R&amp;D outlays, but provides them with no more discretion than that permitted under current rules. The other alternatives reflect increasing discretion over which R&amp;D costs are recognized as assets and the periods over which these assets are amortized. We find that ability to explain the distribution of share prices increases with discretion, and conclude that substantial managerial discretion is likely to be a necessary (though not sufficient) ingredient of any alternative R&amp;D accounting scheme that is capable of producing economically significant financial reporting benefits.",

Our study extends the investigation of the role of risk in returns-earnings relations initiated by Easton and Zmijewski (1989) and Collins and Kothari (1989). Using the standard valuation model in which expected dividends are discounted at risk-adjusted rates, those studies show that ERCs should decline with systematic risk because the present value of a revision in expected dividends declines as systematic risk increases. We refer to this possibility as the “denominator effect” of risk on ERCs. In contrast, we posit a “numerator effect” of risk on ERCs. Specifically, we suggest that ERCs may increase with total risk because the sensitivity of dividend expectations to firm-specific news is an increasing function of risk. Our empirical work finds a robust positive relation between ERCs and total risk that is both economically and statistically significant; however, we find little empirical support for a negative relation between ERCs and systematic risk.",

We also examine the effect of uniformity on analyst coverage, analyst forecast accuracy and analyst forecast dispersion. We develop a Compustat‐based financial statement account uniformity measure based on the presentation of common financial statement line items. We define uniformity using a Jaccard similarity index where a firm's non‐missing Compustat data items are compared to a prototypical firm for that industry year. We emphasize the conceptual difference between uniformity and comparability, and our tests do not show a significant association between uniformity and output‐based accounting comparability. However, we find that the association between account uniformity and comparability becomes positive in high research and development firms, while it becomes negative in firms with higher managerial discretion. We explore the association between uniformity and information processing efficiencies, and we show that our uniformity measure is positively associated with analyst coverage. Furthermore, we partition our uniformity measure into separate income statement and balance sheet components. We find that income statement uniformity is associated with higher forecast accuracy and lower forecast dispersion, while balance sheet uniformity is associated with greater analyst coverage. Finally, we provide further support for these findings using an XBRL‐based uniformity measure.",

Design/methodology/approach The paper compares accrual persistence in the pre‐ and post‐SOX periods to test the first question. Then, partitioning on relative client importance as a measure of auditor independence, the paper compares the SOX‐based improvement for clients of low and high independence audit firms. Findings The study first demonstrates that accrual persistence increased significantly in the post‐SOX period. The study also finds evidence that in the post‐SOX period, the subsample of companies audited by Big‐N auditors with lower‐independence experienced the greatest improvement in accrual persistence. Originality/value This is the first paper to evaluate SOX‐related improvements in the quality of earnings as measured by accrual persistence. Prior studies test abnormal accruals and other earnings management metrics, however, persistence is a more general test of financial statement quality. This study also is the first to compare SOX‐related improvements for clients of firms with differing levels of independence.",

That is to say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know.” Rumsfeld’s statement can be applied to our state of knowledge regarding the accounting for operating leases in the future. There is general agreement (that is, a “known known”) that new standards will require lessees to report most of the assets and related liabilities associated with operating leases on the balance sheet—a significant change from current off-balance-sheet reporting. A “known unknown” is the final form of the accounting standard, including the way leases will be classified (e.g., not operating, but what instead?), and the specific patterns of expense recognition for leases newly recognized on the balance sheet. The “unknown unknowns” can apply to lessee companies that do not yet understand the extent of the preparation and data gathering they face in order to be ready by the new standard’s effective date (whenever that proves to be).",

We report and interpret academic research demonstrating that this activity is somewhat common, and provide practical suggestions that auditors can use to identify it.

This capacity can be so precise that many leading models of human memory assume that only those items learned in the context of a recently studied list compete for recall. We sought to extend the explanatory scope of these models to include not only intralist phenomena, such as primacy and recency effects, but also interlist phenomena such as proactive and retroactive interference. Building on retrieved temporal context models of memory search (e.g., Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009), we present a substantially revised theory in which memory accumulates across multiple experimental lists, and temporal context is used both to focus retrieval on a target list, and to censor retrieved information when its match to the current context indicates that it was learned in a nontarget list. We show how the resulting model can simultaneously account for a wide range of intralist and interlist phenomena, including the pattern of prior-list intrusions observed in free recall, build-up of and release from proactive interference, and the ability to selectively target retrieval of items on specific prior lists (Jang & Huber, 2008; Shiffrin, 1970). In a new experiment, we verify that subjects' error monitoring processes are consistent with those predicted by the model.",

Our lab uses cutting-edge statistical and mathematical tools to explore the relationships\n                     between living things and our changing world. We are primarily focused on animals,\n                     especially vertebrates like the squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and human (Homo sapiens) at right. Our research spans the real and virtual worlds: projects in the QuantEco\n                     lab involve everything from field sampling and bench science to data analysis and\n                     simulation modeling. Use the links at left to explore the lab's research. You can\n                     also find information about the courses I teach.\nIf you  are a KSU undergraduate interested in gaining field and lab research experience\n                     with animals, reach out byemailso we can discuss details. We are currently gearing up for small mammal trapping fieldwork\n                     throughout the rest of 2025 and 2026. There are many levels of involvement available,\n                     from volunteer to research for credit (BIOL3110Lor4400).\nYou can follow the lab onBluesky(@greenquanteco.bsky.social) for updates and events.\nUseful links:\nDepartment of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB)\nMaster of Science in Integrative Biology (MSIB) program\nCollege of Science and Mathematics",

    "bio": "(Source: ASM) Microbiologists work in almost every industry - from food, agriculture and pollution\n                     control to biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and health. They also work in government\n                     agencies and labs, such as the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection\n                     Agency, water treatment facilities, and hospitals. They also work in education as\n                     teachers and researchers. Because there are so many different species of microbes\n                     out there and they do such very different things, no one microbiologist can study\n                     everything! That's why people who become microbiologists usually focus on a particular\n                     microbe or research area. Here are a few examples: Some microbiologists focus on bacteria\n                     and how they help or hurt us. These scientists are called bacteriologists. Some specialize\n                     in viruses and how they infect cells. These scientists are called virologists. Some\n                     study fungi in particular and are called mycologists. Some microbiologists track down\n                     outbreaks of disease to learn what caused them and if we're facing a deadly new microbe.\n                     They are called epidemiologists. Some study how the body defends itself against microbial\n                     invaders. They are called immunologists. This is only a partial listing of the many\n                     different things microbiologists do. If you really want to get a good sense of what\n                     microbiologists do, you should talk to some of them. You might start with the microbiology\n                     researchers here at KSU - Drs. Ramya Rajagopalan, Jean Lu, Micheal Beach, Chris Cornelison,\n                     Premila Achar, Andrew Haddow, Yoshi Masafumi or myself.\nCourses\n2260/2260L Fundamental Microbiology/Fundamental Microbiology Lab4460K Medical Microbiology with Lab3301K Intro to Biotechnology3340/3340L General Microbiology/ Microbiology Lab4635 Advanced Topics in Microbiology: Deadly Microbes7446 Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis (Graduate course)\nResearch Interest\nBacterial pathogenesis\nThe opportunistic human pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosahas one of the largest and most metabolically diverse genomes among bacteria.  The\n                     Griffin lab uses molecular biology approaches from PCR to transcriptomics to investigate\n                     differential regulation by an under-reported epigenetic regulator of a large group\n                     of metabolic pathways and virulence factors.\nPathogen-Specific Phages\nAs bacterial pathogens, especially the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter\n                        baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,andEnterobacterspp.), continually develop resistance to clinical applications of standard antibiotics,\n                     rapid identification of nonchemical-antibiotic therapies are attractive for future\n                     treatment of these organisms. Bacteriophages, viruses that target bacteria, have potential\n                     uses in alternative antibiotic therapies because of their abundance in nature and\n                     their high specificity of infection. Identifying common sources of phages within the\n                     environment, especially those that can infect the ESKAPE pathogens, could reveal untapped\n                     reservoirs of phages that are easily isolated and accessible for uses in clinical\n                     settings.\nCurrent Research Students\nUndergraduates\nJosefa Wulf, Lexie Williams, Francisco Armstrong\nMSIB graduate student\nAlexis Williams\nFuture Directed Study OpportunitiesGriffin lab will be looking for new students for Fall 2025.",

    "bio": "Dr. Lawler's scholarship focuses on equity issues in mathematicseducation; in particular, the ways in which power and knowledge intertwine to govern\n                        the learner's mathematical identity. His core research examines the personal epistemologies\n                        of adolescent mathematicians: Do high school maths students see themselves as mathematical\n                        authors? This interest leads him to seek to understand the ways that students come\n                        to know the school, classroom, and teacher contexts, and how these knowings interact\n                        with their mathematical identities.\nDuring his 30+ year career as a mathematics educator, he has supported teachers, schools,\n                     and districts to de-track mathematics programs and transform teaching practices. He\n                     is a contributing author to the internationally acclaimed high school mathematics\n                     curriculum Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP).\nHis current research projects (district changeandcommunity organizing) focus upon how schools and districts transform their mathematics instruction to\n                     foreground student ways of thinking (inventions) against the backdrop of high-stakes\n                     education.\n\"One [can] teach without reinforcing existing systems of domination.\"(bell hooks, 1994)",

These organisms are important community components\n                     that provide food and shelter for resident animals, stabilize sediments, alter hydrodynamics,\n                     help regulate dissolved oxygen concentrations, and participate in nutrient and carbon\n                     cycling.\nUnfortunately, many of these communities are disappearing around the globe due to\n                     anthropogenic and natural disturbances. As a result, it is essential to understand\n                     how these systems respond to disturbances and develop methods for monitoring and conserving\n                     these valuable habitats.",

    "bio": "I am fascinated by phenotypic variation and how behaviors and the environment can\n                     shape our brain and immune systems. Currently I am studying nature's super-healers\n                     to understand how we can teach the human body to regenerate and recover instead of\n                     scar and atrophy. I look at healing as a whole system: not just cells and genes, but\n                     how they connect and interact with the brain, behavior, and environment.\nI started research as an undergrad, curious how babies develop handedness and using\n                     rats as a model to understand how birth affects the brain. That curiosity grew into\n                     a passion for combining animal behavior with biomedical research. I realized that\n                     behavior (think, biomechanics, movement, and brain plasticity) is often overlooked,\n                     but can be a powerful tool to understand recovery after injury.\nNow, I leadThe Varholick Lab at Kennesaw State University. Our team explores how behavior, the environment, cells, and genes work together\n                     to drive healing, regeneration, and recovery. We're always looking for curious minds\n                     and new ideas, so if you're interested in tissue regeneration and behavior, let's\n                     connect!",
