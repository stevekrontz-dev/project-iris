## DRAFT OUTREACH EMAIL TO DR. PANDARINATH

```
Subject: Collaboration Opportunity - Non-Invasive BCIs for ALS (BrainLab @ KSU)

Dear Dr. Pandarinath,

I'm Steve Krontz, Director of Innovation at The BrainLab at Kennesaw State University, 
where I work alongside Dr. Adriane Randolph, a pioneer in NeuroIS and brain-computer 
interfaces.

I've been following the incredible work from SNEL, particularly your leadership of 
the BrainGate trial at Emory and your deep learning approaches to neural decoding. 
The results you've achieved with ALS patients are remarkable.

We're developing complementary technology - a hybrid eye-gaze and EEG system 
(GazeBCI) designed for non-invasive communication preservation as ALS progresses. 
Our approach focuses on patients who may not be candidates for implanted BCIs or 
who need a bridge technology during earlier disease stages.

I believe there's significant opportunity for collaboration:
- Your invasive BCIs excel when eye-gaze fails completely
- Our non-invasive system maintains communication during progressive decline
- Together, we could offer a continuum of care across the disease trajectory

We're preparing proposals for the ALS Association AT Grant and NIH BRAIN Initiative 
R01, and would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential partnership.

Would you have 30 minutes for a virtual coffee in the coming weeks? I'd love to 
learn more about SNEL's current priorities and explore how BrainLab might contribute.

Best regards,
Steve Krontz
Director of Innovation, The BrainLab
Kennesaw State University

P.S. - Dr. Randolph and I are also building IRIS, an AI-powered research collaboration 
platform that might be valuable for cross-institutional coordination. Happy to demo 
if of interest.
